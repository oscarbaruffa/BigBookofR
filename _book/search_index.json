Im guessing that if youre interested in R then you also like data ;). I initially used Google Analytics for this site but as Im keen to enhance user privacy I switched to Plausible Analytics from 30 December 2020 onward. You can view the old Google Analytics summary report PDF here. TLDR 22k unique visitors and 33k sessions between August 2020 and December 2020 :D!! Note that unique visits will be higher in Plausible than youd find with Google Analytics. Because Plausible is GDPR compliant and privacy focused, each user is identified for only 1 day. If someone visits the site 2 days in a row, thats counted as 2 uniques whereas in Google Analytics it would only be counted as 1 unique visitor because of the presence of persistent cookies and such that allows for tracking of users. From now on, you can view the LIVE site stats right here. 1.7 About me Im Oscar. Fairly new to R and loving it. If you like this book, feel free to say Hi! on Twitter.

One solution to this is to use a programming language such as R to analyse archaeological data, with authors sharing their R code with their publications to communicate our methods. This practice is becoming widespread in many other disciplines, but few archaeologists currently know how to use R or have an opportunity to learn during their training. In this forum we tackle this problem by discussing ubiquitous research methods of immediate relevance to most archaeologists, by using interactive, live-coded demonstrations of R code by archaeologists who program with R. Topics include getting data into R, working with C14 dates, spatial analysis and map-making, conducting simulations, and exploratory data visualizations.

It shows how to use the system to analyze many types of archaeological data. Part I includes tutorials on R, with applications to real archaeological data showing how to compute descriptive statistics, create tables, and produce a wide variety of charts and graphs. Part II addresses the major multivariate approaches used by archaeologists, including multiple regression (and the generalized linear model); multiple analysis of variance and discriminant analysis; principal components analysis; correspondence analysis; distances and scaling; and cluster analysis. Part III covers specialized topics in archaeology, including intra-site spatial analysis, seriation, and assemblage diversity.

Horton This book is intended for readers who want to develop the appropriate skills to tackle complex data science projects and think with data (as coined by Diane Lambert of Google). The desire to solve problems using data is at the heart of our approach. We acknowledge that it is impossible to cover all these topics in any level of detail within a single book: Many of the chapters could productively form the basis for a course or series of courses. Instead, our goal is to lay a foundation for analysis of real-world data and to ensure that analysts see the power of statistics and data analysis. After reading this book, readers will have greatly expanded their skill set for working with these data, and should have a newfound confidence about their ability to learn new technologies on-the-fly. This book was originally conceived to support a one-semester, 13-week undergraduate course in data science. We have found that the book will be useful for more advanced students in related disciplines, or analysts who want to bolster their data science skills. At the same time, Part I of the book is accessible to a general audience with no programming or statistics experience.

That same technology is also available to us at no cost as an analytic tool to allow us to better understand network structures and dynamics in the fields of science, technology, economics, sociology and psychology to name just a few. It is available to academics and practitioners alike, and can be used on problems ranging from a very small network analysis which takes a few minutes on a laptop, to massive scale network mining requiring days or weeks of processing time. But heres the problem: few people really know how to do network analysis. It is still considered by many as a deep specialism or even a dark art. It shouldnt be. This book aims to make the field of graph and network analysis more approachable to students and professionals by explaining the most important elements of theory and sharing common methodologies using open source programming languages like R and Python. It does so by explaining theory in as much detail as is necessary to support analytical curiosity and interpretation, and by using a wide array of example data sets and code snippets to demonstrate the specific implementation and interpretation of methodologies.

Nowhere more so than in the delivery of healthcare. From the understanding of disease and the development of new treatments, to the diagnosis and management of individual patients, the use of data and technology are now an integral part of the business of healthcare. Those working in healthcare interact daily with data, often without realising it. The conversion of this avalanche of information to useful knowledge is essential for high-quality patient care. An important part of this information revolution is the opportunity for everybody to become involved in data analysis. This democratisation is driven in part by the open source software movement  no longer do we require expensive specialised software to do this. The statistical programming language, R, is firmly at the heart of this. This book will take an individual with little or no experience in data science all the way through to the execution of sophisticated analyses. We emphasise the importance of truly understanding the underlying data with liberal use of plotting, rather than relying on opaque and possibly poorly understood statistical tests. There are numerous examples included that can be adapted for your own data, together with our own R packages with easy-to-use functions.

Higgins, MD, PhD, MSc This is a book for anyone in the medical field interested in analyzing the data available to them to better understand health, disease, or the delivery of care. This could include nurses, dieticians, psychologists, and PhDs in related fields, as well as medical students, residents, fellows, or doctors in practice. I expect that most learners will be using this book in their spare time at night and on weekends, as the health training curricula are already packed full of information, and there is no room to add skills in reproducible research to the standard curriculum. This book is designed for self-teaching, and many hints and solutions will be provided to avoid roadblocks and frustration. Many learners find themselves wanting to develop reproducible research skills after they have finished their training, and after they have become comfortable with their clinical role. This is the time when they identify and want to address problems faced by patients in their practice with the data they have before them. This book is for you.

That same technology is also available to us at no cost as an analytic tool to allow us to better understand network structures and dynamics in the fields of science, technology, economics, sociology and psychology to name just a few. It is available to academics and practitioners alike, and can be used on problems ranging from a very small network analysis which takes a few minutes on a laptop, to massive scale network mining requiring days or weeks of processing time. But heres the problem: few people really know how to do network analysis. It is still considered by many as a deep specialism or even a dark art. It shouldnt be. This book aims to make the field of graph and network analysis more approachable to students and professionals by explaining the most important elements of theory and sharing common methodologies using open source programming languages like R and Python. It does so by explaining theory in as much detail as is necessary to support analytical curiosity and interpretation, and by using a wide array of example data sets and code snippets to demonstrate the specific implementation and interpretation of methodologies.

This book teaches you workarounds because data in functional languages is not mutable: for example youll learn how to change variable-value bindings by modifying environments, which can be exploited to emulate pointers and implement traditional data structures. Youll also see how, by abandoning traditional data structures, you can manipulate structures by building new versions rather than modifying them. Youll discover how these so-called functional data structures are different from the traditional data structures you might know, but are worth understanding to do serious algorithmic programming in a functional language such as R.

It emphasizes what you need to know to be able to use the language in any context. There is no fancy statistical analysis here. We just present the basics of the R language itself. We do not assume that you have done any computer programming before (but we do assume that you think it is about time you did). Experienced R users obviously need not read this. But the material may be useful if you want to refresh your memory, if you have not used R much, or if you feel confused.

Paid: $20 Link: https://amzn.to/2x1cYUR 21.23 Modern R with the tidyverse by Bruno Rodrigues This book can be useful to different audiences. If you have never used R in your life, and want to start, start with Chapter 1 of this book. Chapter 1 to 3 are the very basics, and should be easy to follow up to Chapter 9. Starting with Chapter 9, it gets more technical, and will be harder to follow. But I suggest you keep on going, and do not hesitate to contact me for help if you struggle! Chapter 9 is also where you can start if you are already familiar with R and the {tidyverse}, but not functional programming. If you are familiar with R but not the {tidyverse} (or have no clue what the {tidyverse} is), then you can start with Chapter 4. If you are familiar with R, the {tidyverse} and functional programming, you might still be interested in this book, especially Chapter 9 and 10, which deal with package development and further advanced topics respectively.

My name is Wendy Huynh and I am a current PhD student working in the behavioral neurosciences. I began my R journey at the end of my first year of graduate school, slowly and painfully piecing together code. Although programming was never really part of my program, I now see it as an integral part of my work. Many fellow graduate students expressed interest in learning R, but didnt know where to begin. Programming with R is still relatively niche among my cohort and there are very few formal classes teaching this subject. Although there are many amazing guides/textbooks for R out there, very few of them featured examples relevant for my specific needs and were user-friendly enough for a true beginner. In the Fall of my second year, I began teaching a new graduate student in my lab everything I knew about R. However, I quickly found that teaching R  even just to one person  was very time consuming. I decided to write up assignments as a short guide to R. After writing a short 11 page first assignment and receiving positive feedback, I began writing up a second assignment. Then a third. Soon enough, I had written enough pages that I couldnt deny that this short guide had turned into a book.

Tsuda Rcpp is a package that enables you to implement R functions in C++. It is easy to use even without deep knowledge of C++, because it is implemented so as to write your C++ code in a style similar to R. And Rcpp does not sacrifice execution speed for the ease of use, anyone can get high performance outcome. This document focuses on providing necessary information to users who are not familiar with C++. Therefore, in some cases, I explain usage of Rcpp conceptually rather than describing accurately from the viewpoint of C++, so that I hope readers can easily understand it.

This whole story started in the Summer of 2015. I was taking a late night swim on the Bodensee in Konstanz and saw a rusty object sticking out of the water. Upon digging it out, I realized it was an ancient usb-stick with the word YaRrr inscribed on the side. Intrigued, I brought it home and plugged it into my laptop. Inside the stick, I found a single pdf file written entirely in pirate-speak. After watching several pirate movies, I learned enough pirate-speak to begin translating the text to English. Sure enough, the book turned out to be an introduction to R called The Pirates Guide to R.

This book distinguishes itself from other introductory R or statistics books in three ways. First, targeting an audience rarely exposed to statistical programming, it adopts a minimalist approach and covers only the most important functions and skills in R that one will need for conducting reproducible research projects. Second, it emphasizes meeting the practical needs of students using R in research projects. Specifically, it teaches students how to import, inspect, and manage data; understand the logic of statistical inference; visualize data and findings via histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and diagnostic plots; and analyze data using one-sample t-test, difference-of-means test, covariance, correlation, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, and model assumption diagnostics. Third, it teaches students how to replicate the findings in published journal articles and diagnose model assumption violations.

The book beautifully demonstrates how many common statistical tests (such as the t-test, ANOVA and chi-squared) are special cases of the linear model. The book also demonstrates that many non-parametric tests, which are needed when certain test assumptions do not hold, can be approximated by linear models using the rank of values.

Link: https://m-clark.github.io/mixed-models-with-R/ 26.16 Model Estimation by Example Demonstrations with R by Michael Clark This document provides by-hand demonstrations of various models and algorithms. The goal is to take away some of the mystery of them by providing clean code examples that are easy to run and compare with other tools. The code was collected over several years, so is not exactly consistent in style, but now has been cleaned up to make it more so. Within each demo, you will generally find some imported/simulated data, a primary estimating function, a comparison of results with some R package, and a link to the old code that was the initial demonstration. Link: https://m-clark.github.io/models-by-example/ 26.17 Modern Statistics with R by Måns Thulin This book covers the fundamentals of data science and statistics. The first half deals with the basics of R and R coding, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis and more advandced programming. The second half deals with modern statistics (favouring permutation tests, the bootstrap and Bayesian methods over traditional asymptotic methods), regression models and predictive modelling. It also contains information about debugging and explanations of 25 commonly encountered error messages in R. In addition, there are 170 or so exercises with fully worked solutions.

But, drawing from a concept in urban planning, there are far fewer resources in the middle. Stretching the metaphor perhaps to its breaking point, new R users at the detached single-family home stage cant get to the advanced mid-rise level without going through the middle stage. The missing middle in the R neighborhood is the lack of resources to that answer the types of nuts and bolts questions that new R users often have. Things like: How should I organize my file structure when creating a new project? Should I do data cleaning in an RMarkdown file or an R script file? How do I find packages? How do I know if the packages I find are high quality? This book is my attempt to provide answers to these types of questions.
