# New to R? Start here

If you're new to R and want to learn how to use it, this library might be a little daunting.

> There's so much choice! 

If you aren't sure where  to start, then try one these two options:

### Book: R for Data Science

This book is an excellent introduction to R programming and gets you started with visualizing data so you see some exciting stuff, and the power of R, right away. 

The book is free to read at https://r4ds.had.co.nz/

There's an accompanying exercise solution book at https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/

For a different take on the soltuions, check out *Yet another ‘R for Data Science’ study guide* which can also be found at https://brshallo.github.io/r4ds_solutions/

If you'd like more of a roadmap which incoporates thsi book, have a look at my blogpost:
