The first part provides an overview of the machine learning interview process, what types of machine learning roles are available, what skills each role requires, what kinds of questions are often asked, and how to prepare for them. This part also explains the interviewers’ mindset and what kind of signals they look for.\nThe second part consists of over 200 knowledge questions, each noted with its level of difficulty – interviews for more senior roles should expect harder questions – that cover important concepts and common misconceptions in machine learning.\nLink: https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/",

    "text": "6.1 How To Do Archaeological Science Using R\nby Ben Marwick (editor)\nArchaeological science is becoming increasingly complex, and progress in this area is slowed by critical limitation of journal articles lacking the space to communicate new methods in enough detail to allow others to reproduce and reuse new research. One solution to this is to use a programming language such as R to analyse archaeological data, with authors sharing their R code with their publications to communicate our methods. This practice is becoming widespread in many other disciplines, but few archaeologists currently know how to use R or have an opportunity to learn during their training. In this forum we tackle this problem by discussing ubiquitous research methods of immediate relevance to most archaeologists, by using interactive, live-coded demonstrations of R code by archaeologists who program with R. Topics include getting data into R, working with C14 dates, spatial analysis and map-making, conducting simulations, and exploratory data visualizations.\nLink: https://benmarwick.github.io/How-To-Do-Archaeological-Science-Using-R/",

Something that the R community calls “Rtistry.” My Rtistry journey so far has been an amazing and tranquil expedition into a world that seemed intimidating and scary on the outside but is honestly just a bottomless pit of fun and creativity on the inside.\nI’m going to talk about some very basic concepts and perspectives you can think about while starting your own Rtistry journey in ggplot. This includes basics on geoms, aesthetics, layering, etc. But then I’m also going to walk you through two of my Rtistry examples and code to get you started.\nThis article is intended for those who have some experience with ggplot building in R but may not have realized how to transition from making “regular” visuals to Rtistry.

Horton\nThis book is intended for readers who want to develop the appropriate skills to tackle complex data science projects and “think with data” (as coined by Diane Lambert of Google). The desire to solve problems using data is at the heart of our approach.\nWe acknowledge that it is impossible to cover all these topics in any level of detail within a single book: Many of the chapters could productively form the basis for a course or series of courses. Instead, our goal is to lay a foundation for analysis of real-world data and to ensure that analysts see the power of statistics and data analysis. After reading this book, readers will have greatly expanded their skill set for working with these data, and should have a newfound confidence about their ability to learn new technologies on-the-fly.\nThis book was originally conceived to support a one-semester, 13-week undergraduate course in data science. We have found that the book will be useful for more advanced students in related disciplines, or analysts who want to bolster their data science skills. At the same time, Part I of the book is accessible to a general audience with no programming or statistics experience.\nLink: https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr2e/",

In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data.\nLink: https://r4ds.hadley.nz/\nPhysical copy: https://amzn.to/4afCNC6",

Upon first encountering the language after two decades of using Python, I thought Burns was an optimist—after all, hell has rules.\nI have since realized that R does too, and that they are no more confusing or contradictory than those of other programming languages. They only appear so because R draws on a tradition unfamiliar to those of us raised with derivatives of C. Counting from one, copying data rather than modifying it, lazy evaluation: to quote the other bard, these are not mad, just differently sane.\nWelcome, then, to a universe where the strange will become familiar, and everything familiar, strange. Welcome, thrice welcome, to R.\nLink: https://tidynomicon.github.io/tidynomicon/",

It is aimed at people who are relatively new to R, or programming in general. The goal is to give you enough of knowledge of the fundamentals of R to write and adapt code to fit econometric models to data, and to simulate your own data, working alone or with others. You will be able to: read data from csv files, plot it, manipulate it into the form you want, use sets of functions others have built (packages), write your own functions to compute estimators, simulate data to test the performance of estimators, and present the results in a nice format.\nMost importantly, when things inevitably go wrong, you will be able to begin to interpret error messages and adapt others’ solutions to fit your needs.\nLink: https://bookdown.org/kieranmarray/intro_to_r_for_econometrics",

This course provides an introduction to the power and possibility of a reproducible programming language (R) by demonstrating how to import, explore, visualize, analyze, and communicate different types of data. Using water resources based examples, this course guides participants through basic data science skills and strategies for continued learning and use of R.\nIntermediate: In this course, we will move more quickly, assume familiarity with basic R skills, and also assume that the participant has working experience with more complex workflows, operations, and code-bases. Each module in this course functions as a “stand-alone” lesson, and can be read linearly, or out of order according to your needs and interests. Each module doesn’t necessarily require familiarity with the previous module.\nThis course emphasizes intermediate scripting skills like iteration, functional programming, writing functions, and controlling project workflows for better reproducibility and efficiency. Approaches to working with more complex data structures like lists and timeseries data, the fundamentals of building Shiny Apps, pulling water resources data from APIs, intermediate mapmaking and spatial data processing, integrating version control in projects with git.\nLink: https://www.r4wrds.com/",

The lessons below were designed for those interested in working with ecology data in R.\nThis is an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming experience. These lessons can be taught in a day (~ 6 hours). They start with some basic information about R syntax, the RStudio interface, and move through how to import CSV files, the structure of data frames, how to deal with factors, how to add/remove rows and columns, how to calculate summary statistics from a data frame, and a brief introduction to plotting. The last lesson demonstrates how to work with databases directly from R.\nThis lesson assumes no prior knowledge of R or RStudio and no programming experience.\nLink: https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/",

    "text": "21.25 R for Health Data Science\nby Ewen Harrison, Riinu Pius\nIn this age of information, the manipulation, analysis and interpretation of data have become a fundamental part of professional life. Nowhere more so than in the delivery of healthcare. From the understanding of disease and the development of new treatments, to the diagnosis and management of individual patients, the use of data and technology are now an integral part of the business of healthcare.\nThose working in healthcare interact daily with data, often without realising it. The conversion of this avalanche of information to useful knowledge is essential for high-quality patient care. An important part of this information revolution is the opportunity for everybody to become involved in data analysis. This democratisation is driven in part by the open source software movement – no longer do we require expensive specialised software to do this.\nThe statistical programming language, R, is firmly at the heart of this.\nThis book will take an individual with little or no experience in data science all the way through to the execution of sophisticated analyses. We emphasise the importance of truly understanding the underlying data with liberal use of plotting, rather than relying on opaque and possibly poorly understood statistical tests. There are numerous examples included that can be adapted for your own data, together with our own R packages with easy-to-use functions.\nLink: https://argoshare.is.ed.ac.uk/healthyr_book/",

This book is designed for self-teaching, and many hints and solutions will be provided to avoid roadblocks and frustration. Many learners find themselves wanting to develop reproducible research skills after they have finished their training, and after they have become comfortable with their clinical role.

That same technology is also available to us at no cost as an analytic tool to allow us to better understand network structures and dynamics in the fields of science, technology, economics, sociology and psychology to name just a few. It is available to academics and practitioners alike, and can be used on problems ranging from a very small network analysis which takes a few minutes on a laptop, to massive scale network mining requiring days or weeks of processing time.\nBut here’s the problem: few people really know how to do network analysis. It is still considered by many as a deep specialism or even a ‘dark art.’ It shouldn’t be.\nThis book aims to make the field of graph and network analysis more approachable to students and professionals by explaining the most important elements of theory and sharing common methodologies using open source programming languages like R and Python. It does so by explaining theory in as much detail as is necessary to support analytical curiosity and interpretation, and by using a wide array of example data sets and code snippets to demonstrate the specific implementation and interpretation of methodologies.\nLink: https://ona-book.org/",

Where applicable, human judgement is ‘added’ onto a rigorous analysis of the data done in the first place.\nTo achieve this ideal world, I need to equip you with some fundamental knowledge of R and RStudio, which are open-source tools for data scientists.

    "text": "25.2 Handbook of Graphs and Networks in People Analytics With Examples in R and Python\nby Keith McNulty\nThe technology of graphs is all around us, and enables so many of the ways in which we live our lives today. That same technology is also available to us at no cost as an analytic tool to allow us to better understand network structures and dynamics in the fields of science, technology, economics, sociology and psychology to name just a few. It is available to academics and practitioners alike, and can be used on problems ranging from a very small network analysis which takes a few minutes on a laptop, to massive scale network mining requiring days or weeks of processing time.\nBut here’s the problem: few people really know how to do network analysis. It is still considered by many as a deep specialism or even a ‘dark art.’ It shouldn’t be.\nThis book aims to make the field of graph and network analysis more approachable to students and professionals by explaining the most important elements of theory and sharing common methodologies using open source programming languages like R and Python. It does so by explaining theory in as much detail as is necessary to support analytical curiosity and interpretation, and by using a wide array of example data sets and code snippets to demonstrate the specific implementation and interpretation of methodologies.\nLink: https://ona-book.org/",

This book teaches you workarounds because data in functional languages is not mutable: for example you’ll learn how to change variable-value bindings by modifying environments, which can be exploited to emulate pointers and implement traditional data structures. You’ll also see how, by abandoning traditional data structures, you can manipulate structures by building new versions rather than modifying them. You’ll discover how these so-called functional data structures are different from the traditional data structures you might know, but are worth understanding to do serious algorithmic programming in a functional language such as R.\nPaid: $20\nLink: https://amzn.to/2oUG2cP",

Chapter 9 is also where you can start if you are already familiar with R and the {tidyverse}, but not functional programming. If you are familiar with R but not the {tidyverse} (or have no clue what the {tidyverse} is), then you can start with Chapter 4.

I began my R journey at the end of my first year of graduate school, slowly and painfully piecing together code. Although programming was never really part of my program, I now see it as an integral part of my work.\nMany fellow graduate students expressed interest in learning R, but didn’t know where to begin. Programming with R is still relatively niche among my cohort and there are very few formal classes teaching this subject.\nAlthough there are many amazing guides/textbooks for R out there, very few of them featured examples relevant for my specific needs and were user-friendly enough for a true beginner. In the Fall of my second year, I began teaching a new graduate student in my lab everything I knew about R. However, I quickly found that teaching R – even just to one person – was very time consuming. I decided to write up assignments as a “short” guide to R. After writing a short 11 page “first assignment” and receiving positive feedback, I began writing up a second assignment. Then a third. Soon enough, I had written enough pages that I couldn’t deny that this “short guide” had turned into a book.\nLink: https://bookdown.org/yih_huynh/Guide-to-R-Book/",

I was taking a late night swim on the Bodensee in Konstanz and saw a rusty object sticking out of the water. Upon digging it out, I realized it was an ancient usb-stick with the word YaRrr inscribed on the side. Intrigued, I brought it home and plugged it into my laptop. Inside the stick, I found a single pdf file written entirely in pirate-speak. After watching several pirate movies, I learned enough pirate-speak to begin translating the text to English. Sure enough, the book turned out to be an introduction to R called The Pirate’s Guide to R.\nLink: https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/",

The goal of this book is to illustrate the utility of the R programming language for handling these tasks, allowing Census data users to manage their projects in a single computing environment.\nLink: https://walker-data.com/census-r/",

Sparks, PhD\nMy goal for this book is to take the lessons I’ve learned teaching statistics to a diverse and often cursorily trained group of students who have problems they care about, that they need to bring demographic data to bear upon. This is a challenge, and I have always been a stalwart proponent of teaching statistics and data analysis in a very applied manner. As such, this book won’t be going into rigorous proofs of estimators or devoting pages to expositions of icky algebra; instead it will focus on exploring modern methods of data analysis that in used by demographers every day, but not always taught in our training programs.\nLink: https://coreysparks.github.io/appdem_Book/",

Examples include innovation, human development, environmental performance, and so on. This book gives a detailed guide on building composite indicators in R, focusing on the recent COINr package, which is an end-to-end development environment for composite indicators. Although COINr is the main tool used in the book, it also gives general explanation and guidance on composite indicator construction and analysis in R, ranging from normalisation, aggregation, multivariate analysis and global sensitivity analysis.\nLink: https://bluefoxr.github.io/COINrDoc/",

First, targeting an audience rarely exposed to statistical programming, it adopts a minimalist approach and covers only the most important functions and skills in R that one will need for conducting reproducible research projects. Second, it emphasizes meeting the practical needs of students using R in research projects. Specifically, it teaches students how to import, inspect, and manage data; understand the logic of statistical inference; visualize data and findings via histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and diagnostic plots; and analyze data using one-sample t-test, difference-of-means test, covariance, correlation, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, and model assumption diagnostics. Third, it teaches students how to replicate the findings in published journal articles and diagnose model assumption violations.\nPaid: Incl listing of library availability $40\nLink: https://www.worldcat.org/title/using-r-for-data-analysis-in-social-sciences-a-research-project-oriented-approach/oclc/1048009316",

Even though there is no mathematical prerequisite, the authors still introduce fairly sophisticated topics such as likelihood theory, zero-inflated Poisson, and parametric bootstrapping in an intuitive and applied manner. The case studies and exercises feature real data and real research questions; thus, most of the data in the textbook comes from collaborative research conducted by the authors and their students, or from student projects. Every chapter features a variety of conceptual exercises, guided exercises, and open-ended exercises using real data.

The book discusses how to get started in R as well as giving an introduction to data manipulation and writing scripts. From a statistical perspective, the book discusses descriptive statistics and graphing ﬁrst, followed by chapters on probability theory, sampling and estimation, and null hypothesis testing. After introducing the theory, the book covers the analysis of contingency tables, t-tests, ANOVAs and regression. Bayesian statistics are covered at the end of the book.\nLink: https://learningstatisticswithr-bookdown.netlify.app/",

It may also contain information (or links) with thorough descriptions of the method, but the focus here is on implementation. How can you do it in your language of choice? If there are multiple ways, how are those ways different? Is the way you used to do it outdated, or does it do something unexpected? What’s the R equivalent of that command you know about in Stata or SAS, or vice versa?\nLink: https://lost-stats.github.io/",

Calculating post hoc power is not a useful thing to do for single studies.\nThis package, and book, expect readers to have some familiarity with R (2020).

    "text": "37.1 Agile Data Science with R\nby Edwin Thoen\nI joined a Scrum team (frontend, backend, ux designer, product owner, second data scientist) to create a machine learning model that we brought to production using the Agile principles. It was an inspiring experience from which I learned a great deal. My colleagues patiently explained the principles of Agile software development and together we applied them to the data science context.All these experiences culminated in the workflow that we now adhere to at work and I think it is worthwhile to share it. It is heavily based on the principles of Agile software production, hence the title. We have explored which of the concepts from Agile did and did not work for data science and we got hands-on experience in working from these principles in an R project that actually got to production.\nLink: https://edwinth.github.io/ADSwR/",

    "text": "37.4 How I Use R\nby David Keyes\nThere are many great learning resources at the beginner stage and some incredible tutorials to master complex tasks in R. But, drawing from a concept in urban planning, there are far fewer resources in the middle. Stretching the metaphor perhaps to its breaking point, new R users at the “detached single-family home” stage can’t get to the advanced “mid-rise” level without going through the middle stage. The “missing middle” in the R neighborhood is the lack of resources to that answer the types of nuts and bolts questions that new R users often have.\nThings like:\nHow should I organize my file structure when creating a new project? Should I do data cleaning in an RMarkdown file or an R script file? How do I find packages? How do I know if the packages I find are high quality?\nThis book is my attempt to provide answers to these types of questions.\nLink: https://howiuser.com/",

This code has to be reproducible, documented and production ready. Not my original idea, but introduced by the UK’s Analysis Function.\nThe basic idea of a reproducible analytical pipeline (RAP) is to have code that always produces the same result when run, whatever this result might be. This is obviously crucial in research and science, but this is also the case in businesses that deal with data science/data-driven decision making etc.\nA well documented RAP avoids a lot of headache and is usually re-usable for other projects as well.\nLink: https://rap4mads.eu/",

    "text": "4.7 Introduction to Machine Learning Interviews Book\n\nChip Huyen\n\nThis book is the result of the collective wisdom of many people who have sat on both sides of the table and who have spent a lot of time thinking about the hiring process. It was written with candidates in mind, but hiring managers who saw the early drafts told me that they found it helpful to learn how other companies are hiring, and to rethink their own process.\nThe book consists of two parts. The first part provides an overview of the machine learning interview process, what types of machine learning roles are available, what skills each role requires, what kinds of questions are often asked, and how to prepare for them. This part also explains the interviewers’ mindset and what kind of signals they look for.\nThe second part consists of over 200 knowledge questions, each noted with its level of difficulty – interviews for more senior roles should expect harder questions – that cover important concepts and common misconceptions in machine learning.\nLink: https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/",

    "text": "6.1 How To Do Archaeological Science Using R\nArchaeological science is becoming increasingly complex, and progress in this area is slowed by critical limitation of journal articles lacking the space to communicate new methods in enough detail to allow others to reproduce and reuse new research. One solution to this is to use a programming language such as R to analyse archaeological data, with authors sharing their R code with their publications to communicate our methods. This practice is becoming widespread in many other disciplines, but few archaeologists currently know how to use R or have an opportunity to learn during their training. In this forum we tackle this problem by discussing ubiquitous research methods of immediate relevance to most archaeologists, by using interactive, live-coded demonstrations of R code by archaeologists who program with R. Topics include getting data into R, working with C14 dates, spatial analysis and map-making, conducting simulations, and exploratory data visualizations.\nLink: https://benmarwick.github.io/How-To-Do-Archaeological-Science-Using-R/",

This includes basics on geoms, aesthetics, layering, etc. But then I’m also going to walk you through two of my Rtistry examples and code to get you started.\nThis article is intended for those who have some experience with ggplot building in R but may not have realized how to transition from making “regular” visuals to Rtistry.

They only appear so because R draws on a tradition unfamiliar to those of us raised with derivatives of C. Counting from one, copying data rather than modifying it, lazy evaluation: to quote the other bard, these are not mad, just differently sane.\nWelcome, then, to a universe where the strange will become familiar, and everything familiar, strange.

The desire to solve problems using data is at the heart of our approach.\nWe acknowledge that it is impossible to cover all these topics in any level of detail within a single book: Many of the chapters could productively form the basis for a course or series of courses. Instead, our goal is to lay a foundation for analysis of real-world data and to ensure that analysts see the power of statistics and data analysis. After reading this book, readers will have greatly expanded their skill set for working with these data, and should have a newfound confidence about their ability to learn new technologies on-the-fly.\nThis book was originally conceived to support a one-semester, 13-week undergraduate course in data science. We have found that the book will be useful for more advanced students in related disciplines, or analysts who want to bolster their data science skills. At the same time, Part I of the book is accessible to a general audience with no programming or statistics experience.\nLink: https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr2e/",

Words tell us stories, but visualizations show us data stories by transforming quantitative, relational, or spatial patterns into images.

The goal is to give you enough of knowledge of the fundamentals of R to write and adapt code to fit econometric models to data, and to simulate your own data, working alone or with others. You will be able to: read data from csv files, plot it, manipulate it into the form you want, use sets of functions others have built (packages), write your own functions to compute estimators, simulate data to test the performance of estimators, and present the results in a nice format.\nMost importantly, when things inevitably go wrong, you will be able to begin to interpret error messages and adapt others’ solutions to fit your needs.\nLink: https://bookdown.org/kieranmarray/intro_to_r_for_econometrics",

We discuss how these models can be specified in a fully Bayesian modeling framework to jointly fit paid and outstanding claims development data, taking into account the random nature of claims and underlying latent process parameters. We demonstrate how modelers can utilize their expertise to describe specific development features and incorporate prior knowledge into parameter estimation. We also explore the subtle yet important difference between modeling incremental and cumulative claims payments. Finally, we discuss parameter variation across multiple dimensions and introduce an approach to incorporate market cycle data such as rate changes into the modeling process.

This course provides an introduction to the power and possibility of a reproducible programming language (R) by demonstrating how to import, explore, visualize, analyze, and communicate different types of data. Using water resources based examples, this course guides participants through basic data science skills and strategies for continued learning and use of R.\nIntermediate: In this course, we will move more quickly, assume familiarity with basic R skills, and also assume that the participant has working experience with more complex workflows, operations, and code-bases. Each module in this course functions as a “stand-alone” lesson, and can be read linearly, or out of order according to your needs and interests. Each module doesn’t necessarily require familiarity with the previous module.\nThis course emphasizes intermediate scripting skills like iteration, functional programming, writing functions, and controlling project workflows for better reproducibility and efficiency. Approaches to working with more complex data structures like lists and timeseries data, the fundamentals of building Shiny Apps, pulling water resources data from APIs, intermediate mapmaking and spatial data processing, integrating version control in projects with git.\nLink: https://www.r4wrds.com/",

We discuss how these models can be specified in a fully Bayesian modeling framework to jointly fit paid and outstanding claims development data, taking into account the random nature of claims and underlying latent process parameters. We demonstrate how modelers can utilize their expertise to describe specific development features and incorporate prior knowledge into parameter estimation. We also explore the subtle yet important difference between modeling incremental and cumulative claims payments. Finally, we discuss parameter variation across multiple dimensions and introduce an approach to incorporate market cycle data such as rate changes into the modeling process. Examples and case studies are shown using the probabilistic programming language Stan via the brms package in R.\nLink: https://compartmentalmodels.gitlab.io/researchpaper/index.html",

The intuitive nature of these packages makes learning to use them easy and the code easy to read and understand. These tools allow researchers to quickly and accurately complete data preparation for a wide variety of analysis. It is the application of these packages and their approaches to wrangling that are the subject of this book.\nThe Data Wrangling Essentials title was chosen to emphasize both the use of these new tools and the importance of the work of gathering and preparing data.\nLink: https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/DWE/book/",

    "text": "21.25 R for Health Data Science\n\nEwen Harrison\nRiinu Pius\n\nIn this age of information, the manipulation, analysis and interpretation of data have become a fundamental part of professional life. Nowhere more so than in the delivery of healthcare. From the understanding of disease and the development of new treatments, to the diagnosis and management of individual patients, the use of data and technology are now an integral part of the business of healthcare.\nThose working in healthcare interact daily with data, often without realising it. The conversion of this avalanche of information to useful knowledge is essential for high-quality patient care. An important part of this information revolution is the opportunity for everybody to become involved in data analysis. This democratisation is driven in part by the open source software movement – no longer do we require expensive specialised software to do this.\nThe statistical programming language, R, is firmly at the heart of this.\nThis book will take an individual with little or no experience in data science all the way through to the execution of sophisticated analyses. We emphasise the importance of truly understanding the underlying data with liberal use of plotting, rather than relying on opaque and possibly poorly understood statistical tests. There are numerous examples included that can be adapted for your own data, together with our own R packages with easy-to-use functions.\nLink: https://argoshare.is.ed.ac.uk/healthyr_book/",

This book is designed for self-teaching, and many hints and solutions will be provided to avoid roadblocks and frustration. Many learners find themselves wanting to develop reproducible research skills after they have finished their training, and after they have become comfortable with their clinical role.

That same technology is also available to us at no cost as an analytic tool to allow us to better understand network structures and dynamics in the fields of science, technology, economics, sociology and psychology to name just a few. It is available to academics and practitioners alike, and can be used on problems ranging from a very small network analysis which takes a few minutes on a laptop, to massive scale network mining requiring days or weeks of processing time.\nBut here’s the problem: few people really know how to do network analysis. It is still considered by many as a deep specialism or even a ‘dark art.’ It shouldn’t be.\nThis book aims to make the field of graph and network analysis more approachable to students and professionals by explaining the most important elements of theory and sharing common methodologies using open source programming languages like R and Python. It does so by explaining theory in as much detail as is necessary to support analytical curiosity and interpretation, and by using a wide array of example data sets and code snippets to demonstrate the specific implementation and interpretation of methodologies.\nLink: https://ona-book.org/",

That same technology is also available to us at no cost as an analytic tool to allow us to better understand network structures and dynamics in the fields of science, technology, economics, sociology and psychology to name just a few. It is available to academics and practitioners alike, and can be used on problems ranging from a very small network analysis which takes a few minutes on a laptop, to massive scale network mining requiring days or weeks of processing time.\nBut here’s the problem: few people really know how to do network analysis. It is still considered by many as a deep specialism or even a ‘dark art.’ It shouldn’t be.\nThis book aims to make the field of graph and network analysis more approachable to students and professionals by explaining the most important elements of theory and sharing common methodologies using open source programming languages like R and Python. It does so by explaining theory in as much detail as is necessary to support analytical curiosity and interpretation, and by using a wide array of example data sets and code snippets to demonstrate the specific implementation and interpretation of methodologies.\nLink: https://ona-book.org/",

The book is structured around critical R tasks, and focuses on applied knowledge, rather than abstract concepts. The book’s easy-to-read approach helps students with little or no background in statistics or programming to develop real-world R skills through straightforward coverage of R objects and functions. Focusing on real-world data, the challenges of dataset construction, and the use of R’s powerful graphing tools, the guide is written in an accessible and sympathetic style that ensures students acquire functional R skills they can use in their own projects and carry into their work beyond the classroom. A Survivor’s Guide to R focusses on the challenges of learning R, rather than learning statistics. This makes it an effective complement for those who are using other statistics texts, or who already have a statistics background.\nLink: https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/a-survivors-guide-to-r/book242607",

I began my R journey at the end of my first year of graduate school, slowly and painfully piecing together code. Although programming was never really part of my program, I now see it as an integral part of my work.\nMany fellow graduate students expressed interest in learning R, but didn’t know where to begin. Programming with R is still relatively niche among my cohort and there are very few formal classes teaching this subject.\nAlthough there are many amazing guides/textbooks for R out there, very few of them featured examples relevant for my specific needs and were user-friendly enough for a true beginner. In the Fall of my second year, I began teaching a new graduate student in my lab everything I knew about R. However, I quickly found that teaching R – even just to one person – was very time consuming. I decided to write up assignments as a “short” guide to R. After writing a short 11 page “first assignment” and receiving positive feedback, I began writing up a second assignment. Then a third. Soon enough, I had written enough pages that I couldn’t deny that this “short guide” had turned into a book.\nLink: https://bookdown.org/yih_huynh/Guide-to-R-Book/",

Inside the stick, I found a single pdf file written entirely in pirate-speak. After watching several pirate movies, I learned enough pirate-speak to begin translating the text to English.

This book distinguishes itself from other introductory R or statistics books in three ways. First, targeting an audience rarely exposed to statistical programming, it adopts a minimalist approach and covers only the most important functions and skills in R that one will need for conducting reproducible research projects. Second, it emphasizes meeting the practical needs of students using R in research projects. Specifically, it teaches students how to import, inspect, and manage data; understand the logic of statistical inference; visualize data and findings via histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and diagnostic plots; and analyze data using one-sample t-test, difference-of-means test, covariance, correlation, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, and model assumption diagnostics. Third, it teaches students how to replicate the findings in published journal articles and diagnose model assumption violations.\nPaid: Incl listing of library availability $40\nLink: https://www.worldcat.org/title/using-r-for-data-analysis-in-social-sciences-a-research-project-oriented-approach/oclc/1048009316",

My colleagues patiently explained the principles of Agile software development and together we applied them to the data science context.All these experiences culminated in the workflow that we now adhere to at work and I think it is worthwhile to share it. It is heavily based on the principles of Agile software production, hence the title.

But, drawing from a concept in urban planning, there are far fewer resources in the middle. Stretching the metaphor perhaps to its breaking point, new R users at the “detached single-family home” stage can’t get to the advanced “mid-rise” level without going through the middle stage. The “missing middle” in the R neighborhood is the lack of resources to that answer the types of nuts and bolts questions that new R users often have.\nThings like:\nHow should I organize my file structure when creating a new project? Should I do data cleaning in an RMarkdown file or an R script file? How do I find packages? How do I know if the packages I find are high quality?\nThis book is my attempt to provide answers to these types of questions.\nLink: https://howiuser.com/",

This is obviously crucial in research and science, but this is also the case in businesses that deal with data science/data-driven decision making etc.\nA well documented RAP avoids a lot of headache and is usually re-usable for other projects as well.\nLink: https://rap4mads.eu/",

    "text": "4.6 Hiring Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers\n\nRoy Keyes\n\nIt’s quite possible that the only thing more confusing than defining data science is actually hiring data scientists. Hiring Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers is a concise, practical guide to cut through the confusion. Whether you’re the founder of a brand new startup, the senior vice president in charge of “digital transformation” at a global industrial company, the leader of a new analytics effort at a non-profit, or a junior manager of a machine learning team at a tech giant, this book will help walk you through the important questions you need to answer to determine what role and which skills you should hire for, how to source applicants, how to assess those applicants’ skills, and how to set your new hires up for success. Special emphasis is placed on in-office vs remote hiring situations.\nPaid: varies $25\nLink: https://dshiring.com",

It was written with candidates in mind, but hiring managers who saw the early drafts told me that they found it helpful to learn how other companies are hiring, and to rethink their own process.\nThe book consists of two parts. The first part provides an overview of the machine learning interview process, what types of machine learning roles are available, what skills each role requires, what kinds of questions are often asked, and how to prepare for them. This part also explains the interviewers’ mindset and what kind of signals they look for.\nThe second part consists of over 200 knowledge questions, each noted with its level of difficulty – interviews for more senior roles should expect harder questions – that cover important concepts and common misconceptions in machine learning.\nLink: https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/",

    "text": "6.1 How To Do Archaeological Science Using R\nArchaeological science is becoming increasingly complex, and progress in this area is slowed by critical limitation of journal articles lacking the space to communicate new methods in enough detail to allow others to reproduce and reuse new research. One solution to this is to use a programming language such as R to analyse archaeological data, with authors sharing their R code with their publications to communicate our methods. This practice is becoming widespread in many other disciplines, but few archaeologists currently know how to use R or have an opportunity to learn during their training. In this forum we tackle this problem by discussing ubiquitous research methods of immediate relevance to most archaeologists, by using interactive, live-coded demonstrations of R code by archaeologists who program with R. Topics include getting data into R, working with C14 dates, spatial analysis and map-making, conducting simulations, and exploratory data visualizations.\nLink: https://benmarwick.github.io/How-To-Do-Archaeological-Science-Using-R/",

This includes basics on geoms, aesthetics, layering, etc. But then I’m also going to walk you through two of my Rtistry examples and code to get you started.\nThis article is intended for those who have some experience with ggplot building in R but may not have realized how to transition from making “regular” visuals to Rtistry.

The desire to solve problems using data is at the heart of our approach.\nWe acknowledge that it is impossible to cover all these topics in any level of detail within a single book: Many of the chapters could productively form the basis for a course or series of courses. Instead, our goal is to lay a foundation for analysis of real-world data and to ensure that analysts see the power of statistics and data analysis. After reading this book, readers will have greatly expanded their skill set for working with these data, and should have a newfound confidence about their ability to learn new technologies on-the-fly.\nThis book was originally conceived to support a one-semester, 13-week undergraduate course in data science. We have found that the book will be useful for more advanced students in related disciplines, or analysts who want to bolster their data science skills. At the same time, Part I of the book is accessible to a general audience with no programming or statistics experience.\nLink: https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr2e/",

The tutorial then walks the reader through how to replicate plots that are commonly available in point-and-click software such as histograms and boxplots, as well as showing how the code for these “basic” plots can be easily extended to less commonly available options such as violin-boxplots.\nLink: https://psyteachr.github.io/introdataviz/",

Just as sentences become more persuasive with supporting evidence and source notes, your data-driven writing becomes more powerful when paired with appropriate tables, charts, or maps. Words tell us stories, but visualizations show us data stories by transforming quantitative, relational, or spatial patterns into images. When visualizations are well-designed, they draw our attention to what is most important in the data in ways that would be difficult to communicate through text alone.\nLink: https://handsondataviz.org/",

The goal is to give you enough of knowledge of the fundamentals of R to write and adapt code to fit econometric models to data, and to simulate your own data, working alone or with others. You will be able to: read data from csv files, plot it, manipulate it into the form you want, use sets of functions others have built (packages), write your own functions to compute estimators, simulate data to test the performance of estimators, and present the results in a nice format.\nMost importantly, when things inevitably go wrong, you will be able to begin to interpret error messages and adapt others’ solutions to fit your needs.\nLink: https://bookdown.org/kieranmarray/intro_to_r_for_econometrics",

This course provides an introduction to the power and possibility of a reproducible programming language (R) by demonstrating how to import, explore, visualize, analyze, and communicate different types of data. Using water resources based examples, this course guides participants through basic data science skills and strategies for continued learning and use of R.\nIntermediate: In this course, we will move more quickly, assume familiarity with basic R skills, and also assume that the participant has working experience with more complex workflows, operations, and code-bases. Each module in this course functions as a “stand-alone” lesson, and can be read linearly, or out of order according to your needs and interests. Each module doesn’t necessarily require familiarity with the previous module.\nThis course emphasizes intermediate scripting skills like iteration, functional programming, writing functions, and controlling project workflows for better reproducibility and efficiency. Approaches to working with more complex data structures like lists and timeseries data, the fundamentals of building Shiny Apps, pulling water resources data from APIs, intermediate mapmaking and spatial data processing, integrating version control in projects with git.\nLink: https://www.r4wrds.com/",

This Coursera course is based on the Summer 2013 offering of my University of Washington advanced undergraduate economics course of the same name. At the time, my UW course was part of a three course summer certificate in Fundamentals of Quantitative Finance offered by the Professional Masters Program in Computational Finance & Risk Management that was video-recorded and available for online students. An edited version of this course became the Coursera course. The popularity of the course encouraged me to convert the class notes for the course into a short book.\nLink: https://bookdown.org/compfinezbook/introFinRbook/",

Why would you want to use R for handling and processing text? Well, because sooner or later (I would say sooner than later) you will have to deal with some kind of string manipulation for your data analysis. So it’s better to be prepared for such tasks and know how to perform them inside the R environment.\nPaid: Free preview of first 4 chapters $20\nLink: https://www.gastonsanchez.com/r4strings/",

These lessons can be taught in a day (~ 6 hours). They start with some basic information about R syntax, the RStudio interface, and move through how to import CSV files, the structure of data frames, how to deal with factors, how to add/remove rows and columns, how to calculate summary statistics from a data frame, and a brief introduction to plotting. The last lesson demonstrates how to work with databases directly from R.\nThis lesson assumes no prior knowledge of R or RStudio and no programming experience.\nLink: https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/",

    "text": "21.25 R for Health Data Science\n\nEwen Harrison\nRiinu Pius\n\nIn this age of information, the manipulation, analysis and interpretation of data have become a fundamental part of professional life. Nowhere more so than in the delivery of healthcare. From the understanding of disease and the development of new treatments, to the diagnosis and management of individual patients, the use of data and technology are now an integral part of the business of healthcare.\nThose working in healthcare interact daily with data, often without realising it. The conversion of this avalanche of information to useful knowledge is essential for high-quality patient care. An important part of this information revolution is the opportunity for everybody to become involved in data analysis. This democratisation is driven in part by the open source software movement – no longer do we require expensive specialised software to do this.\nThe statistical programming language, R, is firmly at the heart of this.\nThis book will take an individual with little or no experience in data science all the way through to the execution of sophisticated analyses. We emphasise the importance of truly understanding the underlying data with liberal use of plotting, rather than relying on opaque and possibly poorly understood statistical tests. There are numerous examples included that can be adapted for your own data, together with our own R packages with easy-to-use functions.\nLink: https://argoshare.is.ed.ac.uk/healthyr_book/",

This could include nurses, dieticians, psychologists, and PhDs in related fields, as well as medical students, residents, fellows, or doctors in practice. I expect that most learners will be using this book in their spare time at night and on weekends, as the health training curricula are already packed full of information, and there is no room to add skills in reproducible research to the standard curriculum. This book is designed for self-teaching, and many hints and solutions will be provided to avoid roadblocks and frustration. Many learners find themselves wanting to develop reproducible research skills after they have finished their training, and after they have become comfortable with their clinical role. This is the time when they identify and want to address problems faced by patients in their practice with the data they have before them.

One of the more promising uses of satellite time series is its application to classify land use and land cover. Information on land is critical for sustainable development because our growing demand for natural resources is causing significant environmental impacts. The target audience for sits is the new generation of specialists who understand the principles of remote sensing and can write scripts in R. Ideally, users should have basic knowledge of data science methods using R.\nThis book presents sits, an open-source R package for land use and land cover classification using big Earth observation data.\nLink: https://e-sensing.github.io/sitsbook/",

    "text": "23.2 Handbook of Graphs and Networks in People Analytics With Examples in R and Python\n\nKeith McNulty\n\nThe technology of graphs is all around us, and enables so many of the ways in which we live our lives today. That same technology is also available to us at no cost as an analytic tool to allow us to better understand network structures and dynamics in the fields of science, technology, economics, sociology and psychology to name just a few. It is available to academics and practitioners alike, and can be used on problems ranging from a very small network analysis which takes a few minutes on a laptop, to massive scale network mining requiring days or weeks of processing time.\nBut here’s the problem: few people really know how to do network analysis. It is still considered by many as a deep specialism or even a ‘dark art.’ It shouldn’t be.\nThis book aims to make the field of graph and network analysis more approachable to students and professionals by explaining the most important elements of theory and sharing common methodologies using open source programming languages like R and Python. It does so by explaining theory in as much detail as is necessary to support analytical curiosity and interpretation, and by using a wide array of example data sets and code snippets to demonstrate the specific implementation and interpretation of methodologies.\nLink: https://ona-book.org/",

That same technology is also available to us at no cost as an analytic tool to allow us to better understand network structures and dynamics in the fields of science, technology, economics, sociology and psychology to name just a few. It is available to academics and practitioners alike, and can be used on problems ranging from a very small network analysis which takes a few minutes on a laptop, to massive scale network mining requiring days or weeks of processing time.\nBut here’s the problem: few people really know how to do network analysis. It is still considered by many as a deep specialism or even a ‘dark art.’ It shouldn’t be.\nThis book aims to make the field of graph and network analysis more approachable to students and professionals by explaining the most important elements of theory and sharing common methodologies using open source programming languages like R and Python. It does so by explaining theory in as much detail as is necessary to support analytical curiosity and interpretation, and by using a wide array of example data sets and code snippets to demonstrate the specific implementation and interpretation of methodologies.\nLink: https://ona-book.org/",

After covering the use of R for data wrangling and plotting, the book introduces key concepts of data analysis from a Bayesian and a frequentist tradition.

R in itself is not difficult to learn, but as with learning any new language (spoken or computer) the initial learning curve can be a little steep and somewhat daunting. We have tried to simplify the content of this book as much as possible and have based it on our own personal experience of teaching (and learning) R over the last 15 years. It is not intended to cover everything there is to know about R - that would be an impossible task. Neither is it intended to be an introductory statistics course, although you will be using some simple statistics to highlight some of R’s capabilities. The main aim of this book is to help you climb the initial learning curve and provide you with the basic skills and experience (and confidence!) to enable you to further your experience in using R.\nLink: https://intro2r.com/",

I began my R journey at the end of my first year of graduate school, slowly and painfully piecing together code. Although programming was never really part of my program, I now see it as an integral part of my work.\nMany fellow graduate students expressed interest in learning R, but didn’t know where to begin. Programming with R is still relatively niche among my cohort and there are very few formal classes teaching this subject.\nAlthough there are many amazing guides/textbooks for R out there, very few of them featured examples relevant for my specific needs and were user-friendly enough for a true beginner. In the Fall of my second year, I began teaching a new graduate student in my lab everything I knew about R. However, I quickly found that teaching R – even just to one person – was very time consuming. I decided to write up assignments as a “short” guide to R. After writing a short 11 page “first assignment” and receiving positive feedback, I began writing up a second assignment. Then a third. Soon enough, I had written enough pages that I couldn’t deny that this “short guide” had turned into a book.\nLink: https://bookdown.org/yih_huynh/Guide-to-R-Book/",

Upon digging it out, I realized it was an ancient usb-stick with the word YaRrr inscribed on the side. Intrigued, I brought it home and plugged it into my laptop. Inside the stick, I found a single pdf file written entirely in pirate-speak. After watching several pirate movies, I learned enough pirate-speak to begin translating the text to English.

Until recently, the process of working with US Census data has required the use of a wide array of web interfaces and software platforms to prepare, map, and present data products. The goal of this book is to illustrate the utility of the R programming language for handling these tasks, allowing Census data users to manage their projects in a single computing environment.\nLink: https://walker-data.com/census-r/",

This is a challenge, and I have always been a stalwart proponent of teaching statistics and data analysis in a very applied manner. As such, this book won’t be going into rigorous proofs of estimators or devoting pages to expositions of icky algebra; instead it will focus on exploring modern methods of data analysis that in used by demographers every day, but not always taught in our training programs.\nLink: https://coreysparks.github.io/appdem_Book/",

This book gives a detailed guide on building composite indicators in R, focusing on the recent COINr package, which is an end-to-end development environment for composite indicators. Although COINr is the main tool used in the book, it also gives general explanation and guidance on composite indicator construction and analysis in R, ranging from normalisation, aggregation, multivariate analysis and global sensitivity analysis.\nLink: https://bluefoxr.github.io/COINrDoc/",

This book distinguishes itself from other introductory R or statistics books in three ways. First, targeting an audience rarely exposed to statistical programming, it adopts a minimalist approach and covers only the most important functions and skills in R that one will need for conducting reproducible research projects. Second, it emphasizes meeting the practical needs of students using R in research projects. Specifically, it teaches students how to import, inspect, and manage data; understand the logic of statistical inference; visualize data and findings via histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and diagnostic plots; and analyze data using one-sample t-test, difference-of-means test, covariance, correlation, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, and model assumption diagnostics. Third, it teaches students how to replicate the findings in published journal articles and diagnose model assumption violations.\nPaid: Incl listing of library availability $40\nLink: https://www.worldcat.org/title/using-r-for-data-analysis-in-social-sciences-a-research-project-oriented-approach/oclc/1048009316",

It may also contain information (or links) with thorough descriptions of the method, but the focus here is on implementation. How can you do it in your language of choice? If there are multiple ways, how are those ways different? Is the way you used to do it outdated, or does it do something unexpected? What’s the R equivalent of that command you know about in Stata or SAS, or vice versa?\nLink: https://lost-stats.github.io/",

Linking astronomy to the world of modern statistics, this volume is a unique resource, introducing astronomers to advanced statistics through ready-to-use code in the public-domain R statistical software environment. The book presents fundamental results of probability theory and statistical inference, before exploring several fields of applied statistics, such as data smoothing, regression, multivariate analysis and classification, treatment of non-detections, time series analysis, and spatial point processes. It applies the methods discussed to contemporary astronomical research datasets using the R statistical software, making it an invaluable resource for graduate students and researchers facing complex data analysis task.\nLink: https://www.cambridge.org/in/academic/subjects/physics/astronomy-general/modern-statistical-methods-astronomy-r-applications?format=AR",

    "text": "37.4 How I Use R\n\nDavid Keyes\n\nThere are many great learning resources at the beginner stage and some incredible tutorials to master complex tasks in R. But, drawing from a concept in urban planning, there are far fewer resources in the middle. Stretching the metaphor perhaps to its breaking point, new R users at the “detached single-family home” stage can’t get to the advanced “mid-rise” level without going through the middle stage. The “missing middle” in the R neighborhood is the lack of resources to that answer the types of nuts and bolts questions that new R users often have.\nThings like:\nHow should I organize my file structure when creating a new project? Should I do data cleaning in an RMarkdown file or an R script file? How do I find packages? How do I know if the packages I find are high quality?\nThis book is my attempt to provide answers to these types of questions.\nLink: https://howiuser.com/",

This code has to be reproducible, documented and production ready. Not my original idea, but introduced by the UK’s Analysis Function.\nThe basic idea of a reproducible analytical pipeline (RAP) is to have code that always produces the same result when run, whatever this result might be. This is obviously crucial in research and science, but this is also the case in businesses that deal with data science/data-driven decision making etc.\nA well documented RAP avoids a lot of headache and is usually re-usable for other projects as well.\nLink: https://rap4mads.eu/",
