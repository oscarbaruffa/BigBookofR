# Welcome :)

## Your last-ever bookmark
Thanks for stopping by. If you're like me, you can't help but bookmark every R-related programming book you find in the hopes that one day you, or someone you know, might find it useful.


I've been collecting these for about 2 years now, totaling about 100 books, and thought I'd share it with you :).

Hopefully this is the only bookmark you'll need in future ;).

Most of these are free, some are paid (most are very affordable).


## Searching

If there's something specific you're looking for, use the menu or search using the magnifying glass icon at the top of the screen.
