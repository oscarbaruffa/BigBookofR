## Tidyverse design guide
Tidyverse team

The goal of this book is to help you write better R code. It has four main components:

1. Design problems which lead to suboptimal outcomes.

1. Useful patterns that help solve common problems.

1. Key principles that help you balance conflicting patterns.

1. Selected case studies that help you see how all the pieces fit together with real code.

It is used by the tidyverse team to promote consistency across packages in the core tidyverse.

## The R Inferno
Patrick Burns

If R's behaviour has ever suprised you, then this book is a guide for many more surprises, written in the style of Dante. It's a concise report on number of common-errors and unexpected behaviours in R. This book would make more sense, if you have been programming and are familiar with such behaviours (not all though), as there is little time spent on explaining why part of behaviour. As mentioned, it's a concise book, 126 books only.

## How to be a modern scientist
[Jeffrey Leek](https://twitter.com/jtleek)

A book about how to be a scientist the modern, open-source way. 
The face of academia is changing. It is no longer sufficient to just publish or perish. 
We are now in an era where Twitter, Github, Figshare, and Alt Metrics are regular 
parts of the scientific workflow. Here I give high level advice about which tools 
to use, how to use them, and what to look out for. This book is appropriate for 
scientists at all levels who want to stay on top of the current technological 
developments affecting modern scientific careers.
