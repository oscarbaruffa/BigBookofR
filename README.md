# BigBookofR
The biggest collection of R books (and maybe later some other resources too)


## Contributing

This book could still do with a lot of work, and is hosted on [github.](https://github.com/oscarbaruffa/BigBookofR)

The first thing I could use help with is filling out the descriptions of each book. 

The format is this:

**\#\# [Name of book]**

**[Author] -link to twitter bio / blog**

**[Brief description of content]**

**(link to book)**


You can also submit any books not yet included. Sometimes it's difficult to know in which chapter to place it, but I default to using either the name of the book as a guide, the first bit of how the book describes itself or failing that, what I think it should be. It's okay to add a book to more than one section if you feel it strongly fits both. 


Feel free to add both free and paid books - just note which books are a paid resource.
