# Your last-ever bookmark
Thanks for stopping by. If you're like me, you can't help but bookmark every R-related programming book you find in the hopes that one day you, or someone you know, might find it useful.

Hopefully this is the only bookmark you'll need in future ;).

When I initially released this collection in late August 2020, it contained about 100 books that I'd been collecting over the previous two years. Since then I've found a few more and there have been contributions from many people. The collection now stands at over 300 books. 


Most of these are free. Some are paid but usually quite affordable.


## Searching

If there's something specific you're looking for, use the menu or search using the magnifying glass icon at the top of the screen.

## Live stats

Who says you can't have privacy AND transparency??

I'm guessing that if you're interested in R then you also like data ;).

Note that "unique" visits will be higher in Plausible than you'd find with Google Analytics. Because Plausible is GDPR compliant and privacy focused, each user is identified for only 1 day. If someone visits the site 2 days in a row, that's counted as 2 "uniques" whereas in Google Analytics it would only be counted as 1 unique visitor because of the presence of persistent cookies and such that allows for tracking of users. 

From now on, you can view the **[LIVE site stats right here](https://plausible.io/bigbookofr.com?ref=BigBoofofR)**.
