## A crash course on urban accessibility with R

- Rafael H. M. Pereira

Routing and accessibility analyses are increasingly used in urban and transport research and planning. In this workshop, you will learn how to estimate travel time matrices and perform accessibility analyzes in multimodal transport networks using the {r5r} and {accessibility} packages in the R programming language.

The workshop will also illustrate how to calculate different measures of inequality of access to opportunities and accessibility poverty, which are crucial to assess the accessibility impacts of transportation projects from a transportation equity perspective.

## An Introduction to Spatial Data Analysis and Statistics: A Course in R

- Antonio Paez

The objective of this book is to introduce selected topics in applied spatial statistics. My aim with this book is to introduce key concepts and techniques in the
 statistical analysis of spatial data in an intuitive way. While there are other resources that offer more advanced treatments of every single 
one of these topics, this book should be appealing to undergraduate students or others who are approaching the topic for the first time.

## Geospatial Health Data Modeling and Visualization with R-INLA and Shiny

- Paula Moraga

This book describes spatial and spatio-temporal statistical methods and
visualization techniques to analyze georeferenced health data in R.

computational approaches such as the integrated nested Laplace
approximation (INLA) and the stochastic partial differential equation
(SPDE) to analyze areal and geostatistical data.

## Introduction to Spatial Data Programming with R

- [Michael Dorman](https://twitter.com/MichaelDorman84)

This book introduces processing and analysis methods for working with
spatial data in R. The book is composed of two parts. The *first* part
gives an overview of the basic syntax and usage of the R language,
required before we can start working with spatial data. The *second*
part then covers spatial data workflows, including how to process
rasters, vector layers, and both of them together, as well as two
selected advanced topics: spatio-temporal data and spatial
interpolation.

## Introduction to urban accessibility

- Rafael H. M. Pereira
- Daniel Herszenhut

The aim of this book is to equip its readers with the fundamental concepts, the data analysis skills and the processing tools needed to perform urban accessibility analyses and transportation projects impact assessments. The book was written with the problems faced by public managers, policy makers, students and researchers working on urban and transportation planning in mind. Hence, the book is essentially practical. All the material in the book is presented with reproducible examples using open data sets and the R programming language.

- [Tom Heng](https://opengeohub.org/people/tom-hengl)
- [Robert A. MacMillan](https://opengeohub.org/people/bob-macmillan)

Predictive Soil Mapping (PSM) with R explains how to import, process and
analyze soil data in R using the state-of-the-art soil and Machine
Learning packages with ultimate objective to produce most objective
spatial predictions of soil numeric and factor-type variables. Especial
focus has been put on using R in combination with the Open Source GIS
such as GDAL, SAGA GIS and similar, and on using Machine Learning
packages ranger, xgboost, SuperLearner and similar. This book is

## R for Geographic Data Science

- [Stefano De Sabbata](https://twitter.com/maps4thought)

The materials aim to cover the necessary skills in basic programming, data wrangling and reproducible research to tackle sophisticated but non-spatial data analyses. The first part of the module will focus on core programming techniques, data wrangling and practices for reproducible research. The second part of the module will focus on non-spatial data analysis approaches, including statistical analysis and machine learning.

## sits: Data Analysis and Machine Learning on Earth Observation Data Cubes with Satellite Image Time Series

- Gilberto Camara
- Rolf Simoes
- Felipe Souza
- Alber Sanchez
- Lorena Santos
- et al

Using time series derived from big Earth Observation data sets is one of the leading research trends in Land Use Science and Remote Sensing. One of the more promising uses of satellite time series is its application to classify land use and land cover. Information on land is critical for sustainable development because our growing demand for natural resources is causing significant environmental impacts. The target audience for sits is the new generation of specialists who understand the principles of remote sensing and can write scripts in R. Ideally, users should have basic knowledge of data science methods using R.



This book presents sits, an open-source R package for land use and land cover classification using big Earth observation data.

## Spatial Microsimulation with R

- [Robin Lovelace](https://www.robinlovelace.net/)
- [Morgane Dumont](https://directory.unamur.be/staff/modumont)

Imagine a world in which data on companies, households and governments were widely available. Imagine, further, that researchers and decision-makers acting in the public interest had tools enabling them to test and model such data to explore different scenarios of the future. People would be able to make more informed decisions, based on the best available evidence. In this technocratic dreamland pressing problems such as climate change, inequality and poor human health could be solved.

These are the types of real-world issues that we hope the methods in this book will help to address. Spatial microsimulation can provide new insights into complex problems and, ultimately, lead to better decision-making. By shedding new light on existing information, the methods can help shift decision-making processes away from ideological bias and towards evidence-based policy.
