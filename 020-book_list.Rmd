## Modern Data Science with R

Benjamin S. Baumer, Daniel T. Kaplan, and Nicholas J. Horton

This book is intended for readers who want to develop the appropriate
skills to tackle complex data science projects and "think with data" (as
coined by Diane Lambert of Google). The desire to solve problems using
data is at the heart of our approach.

We acknowledge that it is impossible to cover all these topics in any
level of detail within a single book: Many of the chapters could
productively form the basis for a course or series of courses. Instead,
our goal is to lay a foundation for analysis of real-world data and to
ensure that analysts see the power of statistics and data analysis.
After reading this book, readers will have greatly expanded their skill
set for working with these data, and should have a newfound confidence
about their ability to learn new technologies on-the-fly.

This book was originally conceived to support a one-semester, 13-week
undergraduate course in data science. We have found that the book will
be useful for more advanced students in related disciplines, or analysts
who want to bolster their data science skills. At the same time, Part I
of the book is accessible to a general audience with no programming or
statistics experience.

# Data Visualization

## ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis

Hadley Wickham

ggplot2 is an R package for producing statistical, or data, graphics.
Unlike most other graphics packages, ggplot2 has an underlying grammar,
based on the Grammar of Graphics (Wilkinson 2005), that allows you to
compose graphs by combining independent components. This makes ggplot2
powerful. Rather than being limited to sets of pre-defined graphics, you
can create novel graphics that are tailored to your specific problem.

## Hands-On Data Visualization: Interactive Storytelling from Spreadsheets to Code

Jack Dougherty, Ilya Ilyankou

(Oscar: looks like am amazing resource and includes code templates!)

In this book, you'll learn how to create true and meaningful data
visualizations through chapters that blend design principles and
step-by-step tutorials, in order to make your information-based analysis
and arguments more insightful and compelling. Just as sentences become
more persuasive with supporting evidence and source notes, your
data-driven writing becomes more powerful when paired with appropriate
tables, charts, or maps. Words tell us stories, but visualizations show
us data stories by transforming quantitative, relational, or spatial
patterns into images. When visualizations are well-designed, they draw
our attention to what is most important in the data in ways that would
be difficult to communicate through text alone.

guide you in the right path wherever possible.

Most of the books about R programming language will tell you what are
the possible ways to do one thing in R. This book will only tell you one
way to do that thing correctly.

## Modern R with the tidyverse

Bruno Rodrigues

This book can be useful to different audiences. If you have never used R
in your life, and want to start, start with Chapter 1 of this book.
Chapter 1 to 3 are the very basics, and should be easy to follow up to
Chapter 9. Starting with Chapter 9, it gets more technical, and will be
harder to follow. But I suggest you keep on going, and do not hesitate
to contact me for help if you struggle! Chapter 9 is also where you can
start if you are already familiar with R and the {tidyverse}, but not
functional programming. If you are familiar with R but not the
{tidyverse} (or have no clue what the {tidyverse} is), then you can
start with Chapter 4. If you are familiar with R, the {tidyverse} and
functional programming, you might still be interested in this book,
especially Chapter 9 and 10, which deal with package development and
further advanced topics respectively.

Mark Sellors

This field guide aims to introduce the reader to the main components of

that provided the sort of overview of the ecosystem that I know I'd have
appreciated when I first came to the language. And with that thought, a
field guide is born...

## YaRrr! The Pirate's Guide to R

Nathaniel D. Phillips

Learn R from the ground up.

Let me make something very, very clear...

I did not write this book.

This whole story started in the Summer of 2015. I was taking a late
night swim on the Bodensee in Konstanz and saw a rusty object sticking
out of the water. Upon digging it out, I realized it was an ancient
usb-stick with the word YaRrr inscribed on the side. Intrigued, I
brought it home and plugged it into my laptop. Inside the stick, I found
a single pdf file written entirely in pirate-speak. After watching
several pirate movies, I learned enough pirate-speak to begin
translating the text to English. Sure enough, the book turned out to be
an introduction to R called The Pirate's Guide to R.

## R for Graduate Students

Y. Wendy Huynh

Hello! My name is Wendy Huynh and I am a current PhD student working in
the behavioral neurosciences. I began my R journey at the end of my
first year of graduate school, slowly and painfully piecing together
code. Although programming was never really part of my program, I now
see it as an integral part of my work.

Many fellow graduate students expressed interest in learning R, but
didn't know where to begin. Programming with R is still relatively niche
among my cohort and there are very few formal classes teaching this
subject.

Although there are many amazing guides/textbooks for R out there, very
few of them featured examples relevant for my specific needs and were
user-friendly enough for a true beginner. In the Fall of my second year,
I began teaching a new graduate student in my lab everything I knew
about R. However, I quickly found that teaching R -- even just to one
person -- was very time consuming. I decided to write up assignments as
a "short" guide to R. After writing a short 11 page "first assignment"
and receiving positive feedback, I began writing up a second assignment.
Then a third. Soon enough, I had written enough pages that I couldn't
deny that this "short guide" had turned into a book.

## R language for programmers

[John D Cook](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/services-2/)

I have written software professionally in perhaps a dozen programming
languages, and the hardest language for me to learn has been R. The
language is actually fairly simple, but it is unconventional. These
notes are intended to make the language easier to learn for someone used
to more commonly used languages such as C++, Java, Perl, etc.

## R Cookbook - 2nd edition

JD Long, Paul Teetor

I have written software professionally in perhaps a dozen programming
languages, and the hardest language for me to learn has been R. The
language is actually fairly simple, but it is unconventional. These
notes are intended to make the language easier to learn for someone used
to more commonly used languages such as C++, Java, Perl, etc.

## Tidy evaluation

Lionel Henry and Hadley Wickham

This guide is now superseded by more recent efforts at documenting tidy
evaluation in a user-friendly way. We now recommend reading:

The new Programming with dplyr vignette.

The Using ggplot2 in packages vignette.

## Rcpp for everyone

*Masaki E. Tsuda*

Rcpp is a package that enables you to implement R functions in C++. It
is easy to use even without deep knowledge of C++, because it is
implemented so as to write your C++ code in a style similar to R. And
Rcpp does not sacrifice execution speed for the ease of use, anyone can
get high performance outcome.

This document focuses on providing necessary information to users who
are not familiar with C++. Therefore, in some cases, I explain usage of
Rcpp conceptually rather than describing accurately from the viewpoint
of C++, so that I hope readers can easily understand it.

## The R Inferno

Patrick Burns

If R's behaviour has ever suprised you, then this book is a guide for
many more surprises, written in the style of Dante. It's a concise
report on number of common-errors and unexpected behaviours in R. This
book would make more sense, if you have been programming and are
familiar with such behaviours (not all though), as there is little time
spent on explaining why part of behaviour. As mentioned, it's a concise
book, 126 pages only.

## A sufficient Introduction to R

Derek l. Sonderegger

This book is intended to guide people that are completely new to
programming along a path towards a useful skill level using R. I belive
that while people can get by with just copying code chunks, that doesn't
give them the background information to modify the code in non-trivial
ways. Therefore we will spend more time on foundational details than a
"crash-course" would.

and data science, this resource focuses on learning and understanding
basic programming concepts using base R. Only a couple of additional
packages are used and/or briefly discussed for special tasks.

This online book is specifically written for participants of the course
"Introduction to Programming: Programming in R" offered by the Digital
Science Center at Universität Innsbruck.

## Introduction to R - R spatial

R Spatial

This document provides a concise introduction to R. It emphasizes what
you need to know to be able to use the language in any context. There is
no fancy statistical analysis here. We just present the basics of the R
language itself. We do not assume that you have done any computer
programming before (but we do assume that you think it is about time you
did). Experienced R users obviously need not read this. But the material
may be useful if you want to refresh your memory, if you have not used R
much, or if you feel confused.

## Another Book on Data Science : Learn R and Python in Parallel

Nailong Zhang

There has been considerable debate over choosing R vs. Python for Data
Science. Based on my limited knowledge/experience, both R and Python are
great languages and are worth learning; so why not learn them together?

Besides the side-by-side comparison of the two popular languages used in
Data Science, this book also focuses on the translation from
mathematical models to codes. In the book, the audience could find the
applications/implementations of some important algorithms from scratch,
such as maximum likelihood estimation, inversion sampling, copula
simulation, simulated annealing, bootstrapping, linear regression
(lasso/ridge regression), logistic regression, gradient boosting trees,
etc.

## Functional Data Structures in R

[Thomas Mailund](https://twitter.com/ThomasMailund)

Get an introduction to functional data structures using R and write more
effective code and gain performance for your programs. This book teaches
you workarounds because data in functional languages is not mutable: for
example you'll learn how to change variable-value bindings by modifying
environments, which can be exploited to emulate pointers and implement
traditional data structures. You'll also see how, by abandoning
traditional data structures, you can manipulate structures by building
new versions rather than modifying them. You'll discover how these
so-called functional data structures are different from the traditional
data structures you might know, but are worth understanding to do
serious algorithmic programming in a functional language such as R.

Paid\~ \$20

## Domain-Specific Languages in R

[Thomas Mailund](https://twitter.com/ThomasMailund)

Gain an accelerated introduction to domain-specific languages in R,
including coverage of regular expressions. This compact, in-depth book
shows you how DSLs are programming languages specialized for a
particular purpose, as opposed to general purpose programming languages.
Along the way, you'll learn to specify tasks you want to do in a precise
way and achieve programming goals within a domain-specific context.

Domain-Specific Languages in R includes examples of DSLs including large
data sets or matrix multiplication; pattern matching DSLs for
application in computer vision; and DSLs for continuous time Markov
chains and their applications in data science. After reading and using
this book, you'll understand how to write DSLs in R and have skills you
can extrapolate to other programming languages.

Roos](https://twitter.com/DeonRoos88), [Ana
Couto](https://twitter.com/AnaSofiaCouto), [Francesca
Mancini](https://twitter.com/frances_mancini) and [David
Lusseau](https://twitter.com/lusseau)

The aim of this book is to introduce you to using R, a powerful and
flexible interactive environment for statistical computing and research.
R in itself is not difficult to learn, but as with learning any new
language (spoken or computer) the initial learning curve can be a little
steep and somewhat daunting. We have tried to simplify the content of
this book as much as possible and have based it on our own personal
experience of teaching (and learning) R over the last 15 years. It is
not intended to cover everything there is to know about R - that would
be an impossible task. Neither is it intended to be an introductory
statistics course, although you will be using some simple statistics to
highlight some of R's capabilities. The main aim of this book is to help
you climb the initial learning curve and provide you with the basic
skills and experience (and confidence!) to enable you to further your
experience in using R.

## An Introduction to Data Analysis

[Michael Franke](https://twitter.com/meanwhileina)

This book provides basic reading material for an introduction to data
analysis. It uses R to handle, plot and analyze data. After covering the
use of R for data wrangling and plotting, the book introduces key
concepts of data analysis from a Bayesian and a frequentist tradition.
This text is intended for use as a first introduction to statistics for
an audience with some affinity towards programming, but no prior
exposition to R.

## Using R for Data Analysis in Social Sciences: A Research Project-Oriented Approach

Quan Li

This book seeks to teach undergraduate and graduate students in social
sciences how to use R to manage, visualize, and analyze data in order to
answer substantive questions and replicate published findings. This book
distinguishes itself from other introductory R or statistics books in
three ways. First, targeting an audience rarely exposed to statistical
programming, it adopts a minimalist approach and covers only the most
important functions and skills in R that one will need for conducting
reproducible research projects. Second, it emphasizes meeting the
practical needs of students using R in research projects. Specifically,
it teaches students how to import, inspect, and manage data; understand
the logic of statistical inference; visualize data and findings via
histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and diagnostic plots; and analyze
data using one-sample t-test, difference-of-means test, covariance,
correlation, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, and model
assumption diagnostics. Third, it teaches students how to replicate the
findings in published journal articles and diagnose model assumption
violations.

## Common statistical tests are linear models: a work through

Steve Doogue

This is a reworking of the book Common statistical tests are linear
models (or: how to teach stats), written by Jonas Lindeløv. The book
beautifully demonstrates how many common statistical tests (such as the
t-test, ANOVA and chi-squared) are special cases of the linear model.
The book also demonstrates that many non-parametric tests, which are
needed when certain test assumptions do not hold, can be approximated by
linear models using the rank of values.

## Foundations of Statistics with R

Darrin Speegle and Bryan Clair

This book represents a fundamental rethinking of a calculus based first
course in probability and statistics. We offer a **breadth first**
approach, where the fundamentals of probability and statistics can be
taught in one semester. The statistical programming language R plays an
essential role throughout the text through simulations, data wrangling,
visualizations and statistical procedures. Data sets from a variety of
sources, including many from recent, open source scientific articles,
are used in examples and exercises. Demonstrations of important facts
are given through simulations, with some formal mathematical proofs as
well.

This book is an excellent choice for students studying data science,
statistics, engineering, computer science, mathematics, science,
business, or any field which requires the two semesters of calculus
needed to read this book.

## Statistical Rethinking with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse

A Solomon Kurz

This is a love letter I love McElreath's Statistical Rethinking text.
It's the entry-level textbook for applied researchers I spent years
looking for. McElreath's freely-available lectures on the book are
really great, too.

However, I prefer using Bürkner's brms package when doing Bayeian
regression in R. It's just spectacular. I also prefer plotting with
Wickham's ggplot2, and coding with functions and principles from the
tidyverse

So, this project is an attempt to reexpress the code in McElreath's
textbook. His models are re-fit with brms, the figures are reproduced or
reimagined with ggplot2, and the general data wrangling code now
predominantly follows the tidyverse style.

course in probability and statistics. We offer a breadth first approach,
where the fundamentals of probability and statistics can be taught in
one semester.1 The statistical programming language R plays an essential
role throughout the text through simulations, data wrangling,
visualizations and statistical procedures. Data sets from a variety of
sources, including many from recent, open source scientific articles,
are used in examples and exercises. Demonstrations of important facts
are given through simulations, with some formal mathematical proofs as
well.

## Teaching Tech Together

Greg Wilson

Not an R book per se, but comes highly recommended about how to teach
programming.

Grassroots groups have sprung up around the world to teach programming,
web design, robotics, and other skills to free-range learners. These
groups exist so that people don't have to learn these things on their
own, but ironically, their founders and teachers are often teaching
themselves how to teach.

There's a better way. Just as knowing a few basic facts about germs and
nutrition can help you stay healthy, knowing a few things about
cognitive psychology, instructional design, inclusivity, and community
organization can help you be a more effective teacher. This book
presents key ideas you can use right now, explains why we believe they
are true, and points you at other resources that will help you go
further

A quick beginner's guide to using Git and GitHub.You have heard about
git and GitHub and want to know what the buzz is about. That is what I
am here to tell you. Or, at least, I am here to give you a quick
overview of what you can do with git and GitHub. I won't be able, in the
space here, to give you an exhaustive list of features---in all honesty,
I don't know enough myself to be able to claim expertise with these
tools. I am only a frequent user, but I can get you started and give you

# Workflow

## Agile Data Science with R

Edwin Thoen

I joined a Scrum team (frontend, backend, ux designer, product owner,
second data scientist) to create a machine learning model that we
brought to production using the Agile principles. It was an inspiring
experience from which I learned a great deal. My colleagues patiently
explained the principles of Agile software development and together we
applied them to the data science context.All these experiences
culminated in the workflow that we now adhere to at work and I think it
is worthwhile to share it. It is heavily based on the principles of
Agile software production, hence the title. We have explored which of
the concepts from Agile did and did not work for data science and we got
hands-on experience in working from these principles in an R project
that actually got to production.

## How I Use R

David Keyes // R for the Rest of Us

There are many great learning resources at the beginner stage and some
incredible tutorials to master complex tasks in R. But, drawing from a
concept in urban planning, there are far fewer resources in the middle.

Stretching the metaphor perhaps to its breaking point, new R users at
the "detached single-family home" stage can't get to the advanced
"mid-rise" level without going through the middle stage. The "missing
middle" in the R neighborhood is the lack of resources to that answer
the types of nuts and bolts questions that new R users often have.
Things like:

How should I organize my file structure when creating a new project?
Should I do data cleaning in an RMarkdown file or an R script file? How
do I find packages? How do I know if the packages I find are high
quality?

This book is my attempt to provide answers to these types of questions.

## The targets R Package User Manual

Will Landau

The targets package is a Make-like pipeline toolkit for Statistics and
data science in R. With targets, you can maintain a reproducible
workflow without repeating yourself. targets learns how your pipeline
fits together, skips costly runtime for tasks that are already up to
date, runs only the necessary computation, supports implicit parallel
computing, abstracts files as R objects, and shows tangible evidence
that the results match the underlying code and data.

This manual is a step-by-step written guide to targets
