Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include
reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them,
and sample data. In this section you'll learn how to turn your code into
packages that others can easily download and use. Writing a package can
seem overwhelming at first. So start with the basics and improve it over
time. It doesn't matter if your first version isn't perfect as long as
the next version is better.
