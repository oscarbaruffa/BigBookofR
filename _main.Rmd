# Data Visualization

##  ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis
Hadley Wickham

ggplot2 is an R package for producing statistical, or data, graphics. Unlike most other graphics packages, ggplot2 has an underlying grammar, based on the Grammar of Graphics (Wilkinson 2005), that allows you to compose graphs by combining independent components. This makes ggplot2 powerful. Rather than being limited to sets of pre-defined graphics, you can create novel graphics that are tailored to your specific problem.

## R packages
[Hadley Whickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham)

Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data. In this section you’ll learn how to turn your code into packages that others can easily download and use. Writing a package can seem overwhelming at first. So start with the basics and improve it over time. It doesn’t matter if your first version isn’t perfect as long as the next version is better.

# R programming
##  Modern R with the tidyverse
Bruno Rodrigues

This book can be useful to different audiences. If you have never used R in your life, and want to start, start with Chapter 1 of this book. Chapter 1 to 3 are the very basics, and should be easy to follow up to Chapter 9. Starting with Chapter 9, it gets more technical, and will be harder to follow. But I suggest you keep on going, and do not hesitate to contact me for help if you struggle! Chapter 9 is also where you can start if you are already familiar with R and the {tidyverse}, but not functional programming. If you are familiar with R but not the {tidyverse} (or have no clue what the {tidyverse} is), then you can start with Chapter 4. If you are familiar with R, the {tidyverse} and functional programming, you might still be interested in this book, especially Chapter 9 and 10, which deal with package development and further advanced topics respectively.

##  What They Forgot to Teach You About R
Jennifer Bryan and Jim Hester

The initial impetus for creating these materials is a two-day hands-on workshop. The target learner:

Has a moderate amount of R and RStudio experience.Is largely self-taught.Suspects they have drifted into some idiosyncratic habits that may slow them down or make their work products more brittle.Is interested in (re)designing their R lifestyle, to be more effective and more self-sufficient.

## Field Guide to the R Ecosystem
Mark Sellors

This field guide aims to introduce the reader to the main components of the R ecosystem that may be encountered in “the field”.Whatever the reason, whilst there is a wealth of in-depth information for people actually using the language, I could find precious little information that provided the sort of overview of the ecosystem that I know I’d have appreciated when I first came to the language. And with that thought, a field guide is born…

## YaRrr! The Pirate’s Guide to R
Nathaniel D. Phillips

Learn R from the ground up.

Let me make something very, very clear…

I did not write this book.

This whole story started in the Summer of 2015. I was taking a late night swim on the Bodensee in Konstanz and saw a rusty object sticking out of the water. Upon digging it out, I realized it was an ancient usb-stick with the word YaRrr inscribed on the side. Intrigued, I brought it home and plugged it into my laptop. Inside the stick, I found a single pdf file written entirely in pirate-speak. After watching several pirate movies, I learned enough pirate-speak to begin translating the text to English. Sure enough, the book turned out to be an introduction to R called The Pirate’s Guide to R.

## Advanced R.
[Hadley Whickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham)

This is the companion website for “Advanced R”, a book in Chapman & Hall’s R Series. The book is designed primarily for R users who want to improve their programming skills and understanding of the language. It should also be useful for programmers coming to R from other languages, as it explains some of R’s quirks and shows how some parts that seem horrible do have a positive side.

The book is free online.

## The Tidyverse Cookbook
Edited by Garrett Grolemund

This book collects code recipes for doing data science with R’s tidyverse. Each recipe solves a single common task, with a minimum of discussion. 

https://rstudio-education.github.io/tidyverse-cookbook/

## The tidyverse style guide
[Hadley Whickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham)

Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread. This site describes the style used throughout the tidyverse. It was derived from Google’s original R Style Guide - but Google’s current guide is derived from the tidyverse style guide.

https://style.tidyverse.org/


## Tidyverse design guide
Tidyverse team

The goal of this book is to help you write better R code. It has four main components:

1. Design problems which lead to suboptimal outcomes.

1. Useful patterns that help solve common problems.

1. Key principles that help you balance conflicting patterns.

1. Selected case studies that help you see how all the pieces fit together with real code.

It is used by the tidyverse team to promote consistency across packages in the core tidyverse.

## R language for programmers
[John D Cook](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/services-2/)

I have written software professionally in perhaps a dozen programming languages, and the hardest language for me to learn has been R. The language is actually fairly simple, but it is unconventional. These notes are intended to make the language easier to learn for someone used to more commonly used languages such as C++, Java, Perl, etc.

## The R Inferno
Patrick Burns

If R's behaviour has ever suprised you, then this book is a guide for many more surprises, written in the style of Dante. It's a concise report on number of common-errors and unexpected behaviours in R. This book would make more sense, if you have been programming and are familiar with such behaviours (not all though), as there is little time spent on explaining why part of behaviour. As mentioned, it's a concise book, 126 books only.

## A sufficient Introduction to R
Derek l. Sonderegger

This book is intended to guide people that are completely new to programming along a path towards a useful skill level using R. I belive that while people can get by with just copying code chunks, that doesn’t give them the background information to modify the code in non-trivial ways. Therefore we will spend more time on foundational details than a “crash-course” would.

## Introduction to Programming with R
Reto Stauffer, Joanna Chimiak-Opoka, Thorsten Simon, Achim Zeileis

a learning resource for programming novices who want to learn programming using the statistical programming language R. While one of the major strengths of R is the broad variety of packages for statistics and data science, this resource focuses on learning and understanding basic programming concepts using base R. Only a couple of additional packages are used and/or briefly discussed for special tasks.

This online book is specifically written for participants of the course “Introduction to Programming: Programming in R” offered by the Digital Science Center at Universität Innsbruck.

## Introduction to R - R spatial 
R Spatial

This document provides a concise introduction to R. It emphasizes what you need to know to be able to use the language in any context. There is no fancy statistical analysis here. We just present the basics of the R language itself. We do not assume that you have done any computer programming before (but we do assume that you think it is about time you did). Experienced R users obviously need not read this. But the material may be useful if you want to refresh your memory, if you have not used R much, or if you feel confused.

## Another Book on Data Science : Learn R and Python in Parallel
Nailong Zhang

There has been considerable debate over choosing R vs. Python for Data Science. Based on my limited knowledge/experience, both R and Python are great languages and are worth learning; so why not learn them together?

Besides the side-by-side comparison of the two popular languages used in Data Science, this book also focuses on the translation from mathematical models to codes. In the book, the audience could find the applications/implementations of some important algorithms from scratch, such as maximum likelihood estimation, inversion sampling, copula simulation, simulated annealing, bootstrapping, linear regression (lasso/ridge regression), logistic regression, gradient boosting trees, etc.

# Statistics

##  Common statistical tests are linear models: a work through
Steve Doogue

This is a reworking of the book Common statistical tests are linear models (or: how to teach stats), written by Jonas Lindeløv. The book beautifully demonstrates how many common statistical tests (such as the t-test, ANOVA and chi-squared) are special cases of the linear model. The book also demonstrates that many non-parametric tests, which are needed when certain test assumptions do not hold, can be approximated by linear models using the rank of values.

# Teaching

## Teaching Tech Together
Greg Wilson

Not an R book per se, but comes highly recommended about how to teach programming. 

Grassroots groups have sprung up around the world to teach programming, web design, robotics, and other skills to free-range learners. These groups exist so that people don’t have to learn these things on their own, but ironically, their founders and teachers are often teaching themselves how to teach.

There’s a better way. Just as knowing a few basic facts about germs and nutrition can help you stay healthy, knowing a few things about cognitive psychology, instructional design, inclusivity, and community organization can help you be a more effective teacher. This book presents key ideas you can use right now, explains why we believe they are true, and points you at other resources that will help you go further

# Workflow
##  How I Use R
David Keyes // R for the Rest of Us

There are many great learning resources at the beginner stage and some incredible tutorials to master complex tasks in R. But, drawing from a concept in urban planning, there are far fewer resources in the middle.

Stretching the metaphor perhaps to its breaking point, new R users at the “detached single-family home” stage can’t get to the advanced “mid-rise” level without going through the middle stage. The “missing middle” in the R neighborhood is the lack of resources to that answer the types of nuts and bolts questions that new R users often have. Things like:

How should I organize my file structure when creating a new project? Should I do data cleaning in an RMarkdown file or an R script file? How do I find packages? How do I know if the packages I find are high quality? 

This book is my attempt to provide answers to these types of questions.

## Agile Data Science with R
Edwin Thoen

I joined a Scrum team (frontend, backend, ux designer, product owner, second data scientist) to create a machine learning model that we brought to production using the Agile principles. It was an inspiring experience from which I learned a great deal. My colleagues patiently explained the principles of Agile software development and together we applied them to the data science context.All these experiences culminated in the workflow that we now adhere to at work and I think it is worthwhile to share it. It is heavily based on the principles of Agile software production, hence the title. We have explored which of the concepts from Agile did and did not work for data science and we got hands-on experience in working from these principles in an R project that actually got to production.

## Introduction to Econometrics with R
Christoph Hanck, Martin Arnold, Alexander Gerber, and Martin Schmelzer

Instead of confronting students with pure coding exercises and complementary classic literature like the book by Venables & Smith (2010), we figured it would be better to provide interactive learning material that blends R code with the contents of the well-received textbook Introduction to Econometrics by Stock & Watson (2015) which serves as a basis for the lecture.

## How to be a modern scientist
[Jeffrey Leek](https://twitter.com/jtleek)

A book about how to be a scientist the modern, open-source way. 
The face of academia is changing. It is no longer sufficient to just publish or perish. 
We are now in an era where Twitter, Github, Figshare, and Alt Metrics are regular 
parts of the scientific workflow. Here I give high level advice about which tools 
to use, how to use them, and what to look out for. This book is appropriate for 
scientists at all levels who want to stay on top of the current technological 
developments affecting modern scientific careers.

Pay what you want for the ebook, minimum $0.00

## Use R! Springer series

This is a collection of some 70+ books. This series of inexpensive and focused books on R will publish shorter books aimed at practitioners. Books can discuss the use of R in a particular subject area (e.g., epidemiology, econometrics, psychometrics) or as it relates to statistical topics (e.g., missing data, longitudinal data).

All are paid products

##  Data Science with R: A Resource Compendium
Martin Monkman

This book grew out of my evergrowing collection of reference materials that was saved as an expanding array of markdown files in a github repo. By assembling it as a book, I hope that it will be more accessible and useful to other R users.

## CRAN doc collections

Note these projects are frozen, but they do contain a lot of resources in multiple languages. 

Many of these are quite old publications, but it doesn't mean they're outdated or not useful. If you're really digging for a specific resource that you can't find anywhere else, it may be here. Good luck!
