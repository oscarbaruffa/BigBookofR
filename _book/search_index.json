If you have never used R in your life, and want to start, start with Chapter 1 of this book. Chapter 1 to 3 are the very basics, and should be easy to follow up to Chapter 9. Starting with Chapter 9, it gets more technical, and will be harder to follow. But I suggest you keep on going, and do not hesitate to contact me for help if you struggle! Chapter 9 is also where you can start if you are already familiar with R and the {tidyverse}, but not functional programming. If you are familiar with R but not the {tidyverse} (or have no clue what the {tidyverse} is), then you can start with Chapter 4. If you are familiar with R, the {tidyverse} and functional programming, you might still be interested in this book, especially Chapter 9 and 10, which deal with package development and further advanced topics respectively. https://b-rodrigues.github.io/modern_R/ 16.2 stats545 Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R Jenny Bryan Learn how to: Explore, groom, visualize, and analyze data, make all of that reproducible, reusable, and shareable, using R.

And with that thought, a field guide is born… https://fg2re.sellorm.com/ 16.5 YaRrr! The Pirate’s Guide to R Nathaniel D. Phillips Learn R from the ground up. Let me make something very, very clear… I did not write this book. This whole story started in the Summer of 2015. I was taking a late night swim on the Bodensee in Konstanz and saw a rusty object sticking out of the water. Upon digging it out, I realized it was an ancient usb-stick with the word YaRrr inscribed on the side. Intrigued, I brought it home and plugged it into my laptop. Inside the stick, I found a single pdf file written entirely in pirate-speak. After watching several pirate movies, I learned enough pirate-speak to begin translating the text to English. Sure enough, the book turned out to be an introduction to R called The Pirate’s Guide to R. https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/ 16.6 Advanced R. Hadley Whickham This is the companion website for “Advanced R”, a book in Chapman &amp; Hall’s R Series. The book is designed primarily for R users who want to improve their programming skills and understanding of the language. It should also be useful for programmers coming to R from other languages, as it explains some of R’s quirks and shows how some parts that seem horrible do have a positive side.

It has four main components: Design problems which lead to suboptimal outcomes. Useful patterns that help solve common problems. Key principles that help you balance conflicting patterns. Selected case studies that help you see how all the pieces fit together with real code.

Ellis, Stephanie C. Hicks and Roger D. Peng Book and Course formats This course introduces a powerful set of data science tools known as the Tidyverse. The Tidyverse has revolutionized the way in which data scientists do almost every aspect of their job. We will cover the simple idea of “tidy data” and how this idea serves to organize data for analysis and modeling. We will also cover how non-tidy data can be transformed to tidy data, the data science project life cycle, and the ecosystem of Tidyverse R packages that can be used to execute a data science project.

It’s a concise report on number of common-errors and unexpected behaviours in R.

Sonderegger This book is intended to guide people that are completely new to programming along a path towards a useful skill level using R.

It emphasizes what you need to know to be able to use the language in any context. There is no fancy statistical analysis here. We just present the basics of the R language itself. We do not assume that you have done any computer programming before (but we do assume that you think it is about time you did). Experienced R users obviously need not read this.

Based on my limited knowledge/experience, both R and Python are great languages and are worth learning; so why not learn them together? Besides the side-by-side comparison of the two popular languages used in Data Science, this book also focuses on the translation from mathematical models to codes. In the book, the audience could find the applications/implementations of some important algorithms from scratch, such as maximum likelihood estimation, inversion sampling, copula simulation, simulated annealing, bootstrapping, linear regression (lasso/ridge regression), logistic regression, gradient boosting trees, etc. https://www.anotherbookondatascience.com/ 16.24 Functional Programming in R Thomas Mailund Master functions and discover how to write functional programs in R.

This book teaches you workarounds because data in functional languages is not mutable: for example you’ll learn how to change variable-value bindings by modifying environments, which can be exploited to emulate pointers and implement traditional data structures. You’ll also see how, by abandoning traditional data structures, you can manipulate structures by building new versions rather than modifying them. You’ll discover how these so-called functional data structures are different from the traditional data structures you might know, but are worth understanding to do serious algorithmic programming in a functional language such as R. Paid~ $20 https://amzn.to/2oUG2cP 16.28 Domain-Specific Languages in R Thomas Mailund Gain an accelerated introduction to domain-specific languages in R, including coverage of regular expressions. This compact, in-depth book shows you how DSLs are programming languages specialized for a particular purpose, as opposed to general purpose programming languages. Along the way, you’ll learn to specify tasks you want to do in a precise way and achieve programming goals within a domain-specific context. Domain-Specific Languages in R includes examples of DSLs including large data sets or matrix multiplication; pattern matching DSLs for application in computer vision; and DSLs for continuous time Markov chains and their applications in data science. After reading and using this book, you’ll understand how to write DSLs in R and have skills you can extrapolate to other programming languages. Paid ~$25 https://amzn.to/2CDqhAU "],

Grassroots groups have sprung up around the world to teach programming, web design, robotics, and other skills to free-range learners. These groups exist so that people don’t have to learn these things on their own, but ironically, their founders and teachers are often teaching themselves how to teach. There’s a better way. Just as knowing a few basic facts about germs and nutrition can help you stay healthy, knowing a few things about cognitive psychology, instructional design, inclusivity, and community organization can help you be a more effective teacher.

It was an inspiring experience from which I learned a great deal. My colleagues patiently explained the principles of Agile software development and together we applied them to the data science context.All these experiences culminated in the workflow that we now adhere to at work and I think it is worthwhile to share it. It is heavily based on the principles of Agile software production, hence the title.

But, drawing from a concept in urban planning, there are far fewer resources in the middle. Stretching the metaphor perhaps to its breaking point, new R users at the “detached single-family home” stage can’t get to the advanced “mid-rise” level without going through the middle stage. The “missing middle” in the R neighborhood is the lack of resources to that answer the types of nuts and bolts questions that new R users often have. Things like: How should I organize my file structure when creating a new project? Should I do data cleaning in an RMarkdown file or an R script file? How do I find packages? How do I know if the packages I find are high quality? This book is my attempt to provide answers to these types of questions. https://howiuser.com/ 24.4 Github actions with R Chris Brown, Murray Cadzow, Paula A Martinez, Rhydwyn McGuire, David Neuzerling, David Wilkinson, Saras Windecker GitHub actions allow us to trigger automated steps after we launch GitHub interactions such as when we push, pull, submit a pull request, or write an issue. https://ropenscilabs.github.io/actions_sandbox/ 24.5 The targets R Package User Manual Will Landau The targets package is a Make-like pipeline toolkit for Statistics and data science in R.
