# Welcome :)

## Your last-ever bookmark
Thanks for stopping by. If you're like me, you can't help but bookmark every R-related programming book you find in the hopes that one day you, or someone you know, might find it useful.


I've been collecting these for about 2 years now, totaling about 100 books, and thought I'd share it with you :).

Hopefully this is the only bookmark you'll need in future ;).

Most of these are free, some are paid (most are very affordable).


## Searching

If there's something specific you're looking for, use the menu or search using the magnifying glass icon at the top of the screen.


## Contributing

Please feel free to contribute paid and free books - see the  [github.](https://github.com/oscarbaruffa/BigBookofR)

The format for adding book entries is:

**\#\# [Name of book]**

**[Author] -link to twitter bio / blog**

**[Brief description of content]**

**Note if its a paid product and approximatley how much** 

**(link to book)**


Sometimes it's difficult to know in which chapter to place it, but I default to using either the name of the book as a guide, the first bit of how the book describes itself or failing that, what I think it should be. It's okay to add a book to more than one section if you feel it strongly fits both.
