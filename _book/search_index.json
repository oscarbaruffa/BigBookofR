Im guessing that if youre interested in R then you also like data ;). I initially used Google Analytics for this site but as Im keen to enhance user privacy I switched to Plausible Analytics from 30 December 2020 onward. You can view the old Google Analytics summary report PDF here. TLDR 22k unique visitors and 33k sessions between August 2020 and December 2020 :D!! Note that unique visits will be higher in Plausible than youd find with Google Analytics. Because Plausible is GDPR compliant and privacy focused, each user is identified for only 1 day. If someone visits the site 2 days in a row, thats counted as 2 uniques whereas in Google Analytics it would only be counted as 1 unique visitor because of the presence of persistent cookies and such that allows for tracking of users.

My name is Wendy Huynh and I am a current PhD student working in the behavioral neurosciences. I began my R journey at the end of my first year of graduate school, slowly and painfully piecing together code. Although programming was never really part of my program, I now see it as an integral part of my work. Many fellow graduate students expressed interest in learning R, but didnt know where to begin. Programming with R is still relatively niche among my cohort and there are very few formal classes teaching this subject. Although there are many amazing guides/textbooks for R out there, very few of them featured examples relevant for my specific needs and were user-friendly enough for a true beginner. In the Fall of my second year, I began teaching a new graduate student in my lab everything I knew about R. However, I quickly found that teaching R  even just to one person  was very time consuming. I decided to write up assignments as a short guide to R. After writing a short 11 page first assignment and receiving positive feedback, I began writing up a second assignment. Then a third. Soon enough, I had written enough pages that I couldnt deny that this short guide had turned into a book. https://bookdown.org/yih_huynh/Guide-to-R-Book/ 20.17 R language for programmers John D Cook I have written software professionally in perhaps a dozen programming languages, and the hardest language for me to learn has been R. The language is actually fairly simple, but it is unconventional. These notes are intended to make the language easier to learn for someone used to more commonly used languages such as C++, Java, Perl, etc. https://www.johndcook.com/blog/r_language_for_programmers/ 20.18 R Cookbook - 2nd edition JD Long, Paul Teetor I have written software professionally in perhaps a dozen programming languages, and the hardest language for me to learn has been R. The language is actually fairly simple, but it is unconventional. These notes are intended to make the language easier to learn for someone used to more commonly used languages such as C++, Java, Perl, etc. Not to be confused with Cookbook for R https://rc2e.com/index.html 20.19 Cookbook for R Winston Chang The goal of the cookbook is to provide solutions to common tasks and problems in analyzing data. Not to be confused with R Cookbook http://www.cookbook-r.com/ 20.20 Tidy evaluation Lionel Henry and Hadley Wickham This guide is now superseded by more recent efforts at documenting tidy evaluation in a user-friendly way. We now recommend reading: The new Programming with dplyr vignette. The Using ggplot2 in packages vignette. (Oscars note: Im keeping this in for my own reference) https://tidyeval.tidyverse.org/ 20.21 Rcpp for everyone Masaki E. Tsuda Rcpp is a package that enables you to implement R functions in C++. It is easy to use even without deep knowledge of C++, because it is implemented so as to write your C++ code in a style similar to R. And Rcpp does not sacrifice execution speed for the ease of use, anyone can get high performance outcome. This document focuses on providing necessary information to users who are not familiar with C++. Therefore, in some cases, I explain usage of Rcpp conceptually rather than describing accurately from the viewpoint of C++, so that I hope readers can easily understand it. https://teuder.github.io/rcpp4everyone_en/ 20.22 The R Inferno Patrick Burns If Rs behaviour has ever suprised you, then this book is a guide for many more surprises, written in the style of Dante. Its a concise report on number of common-errors and unexpected behaviours in R. This book would make more sense, if you have been programming and are familiar with such behaviours (not all though), as there is little time spent on explaining why part of behaviour. As mentioned, its a concise book, 126 pages only. https://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf 20.23 A sufficient Introduction to R Derek l. Sonderegger This book is intended to guide people that are completely new to programming along a path towards a useful skill level using R. I belive that while people can get by with just copying code chunks, that doesnt give them the background information to modify the code in non-trivial ways. Therefore we will spend more time on foundational details than a crash-course would. https://dereksonderegger.github.io/570L/ 20.24 Introduction to Programming with R Reto Stauffer, Joanna Chimiak-Opoka, Thorsten Simon, Achim Zeileis a learning resource for programming novices who want to learn programming using the statistical programming language R. While one of the major strengths of R is the broad variety of packages for statistics and data science, this resource focuses on learning and understanding basic programming concepts using base R. Only a couple of additional packages are used and/or briefly discussed for special tasks.

It emphasizes what you need to know to be able to use the language in any context. There is no fancy statistical analysis here. We just present the basics of the R language itself. We do not assume that you have done any computer programming before (but we do assume that you think it is about time you did). Experienced R users obviously need not read this. But the material may be useful if you want to refresh your memory, if you have not used R much, or if you feel confused. https://rspatial.org/intr/index.html 20.27 Another Book on Data Science : Learn R and Python in Parallel Nailong Zhang There has been considerable debate over choosing R vs. Python for Data Science. Based on my limited knowledge/experience, both R and Python are great languages and are worth learning; so why not learn them together? Besides the side-by-side comparison of the two popular languages used in Data Science, this book also focuses on the translation from mathematical models to codes. In the book, the audience could find the applications/implementations of some important algorithms from scratch, such as maximum likelihood estimation, inversion sampling, copula simulation, simulated annealing, bootstrapping, linear regression (lasso/ridge regression), logistic regression, gradient boosting trees, etc. https://www.anotherbookondatascience.com/ 20.28 Functional Programming in R Thomas Mailund Master functions and discover how to write functional programs in R.

This book teaches you workarounds because data in functional languages is not mutable: for example youll learn how to change variable-value bindings by modifying environments, which can be exploited to emulate pointers and implement traditional data structures. Youll also see how, by abandoning traditional data structures, you can manipulate structures by building new versions rather than modifying them. Youll discover how these so-called functional data structures are different from the traditional data structures you might know, but are worth understanding to do serious algorithmic programming in a functional language such as R. Paid~ $20 https://amzn.to/2oUG2cP 20.32 Domain-Specific Languages in R Thomas Mailund Gain an accelerated introduction to domain-specific languages in R, including coverage of regular expressions. This compact, in-depth book shows you how DSLs are programming languages specialized for a particular purpose, as opposed to general purpose programming languages. Along the way, youll learn to specify tasks you want to do in a precise way and achieve programming goals within a domain-specific context. Domain-Specific Languages in R includes examples of DSLs including large data sets or matrix multiplication; pattern matching DSLs for application in computer vision; and DSLs for continuous time Markov chains and their applications in data science. After reading and using this book, youll understand how to write DSLs in R and have skills you can extrapolate to other programming languages. Paid ~$25 https://amzn.to/2CDqhAU 20.33 An Introduction to R Alex Douglas, Deon Roos, Ana Couto, Francesca Mancini and David Lusseau The aim of this book is to introduce you to using R, a powerful and flexible interactive environment for statistical computing and research. R in itself is not difficult to learn, but as with learning any new language (spoken or computer) the initial learning curve can be a little steep and somewhat daunting. We have tried to simplify the content of this book as much as possible and have based it on our own personal experience of teaching (and learning) R over the last 15 years. It is not intended to cover everything there is to know about R - that would be an impossible task. Neither is it intended to be an introductory statistics course, although you will be using some simple statistics to highlight some of Rs capabilities. The main aim of this book is to help you climb the initial learning curve and provide you with the basic skills and experience (and confidence!) to enable you to further your experience in using R. https://intro2r.com/ 20.34 An Introduction to Data Analysis Michael Franke This book provides basic reading material for an introduction to data analysis. It uses R to handle, plot and analyze data. After covering the use of R for data wrangling and plotting, the book introduces key concepts of data analysis from a Bayesian and a frequentist tradition.

This book distinguishes itself from other introductory R or statistics books in three ways. First, targeting an audience rarely exposed to statistical programming, it adopts a minimalist approach and covers only the most important functions and skills in R that one will need for conducting reproducible research projects. Second, it emphasizes meeting the practical needs of students using R in research projects. Specifically, it teaches students how to import, inspect, and manage data; understand the logic of statistical inference; visualize data and findings via histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and diagnostic plots; and analyze data using one-sample t-test, difference-of-means test, covariance, correlation, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, and model assumption diagnostics. Third, it teaches students how to replicate the findings in published journal articles and diagnose model assumption violations.

Grassroots groups have sprung up around the world to teach programming, web design, robotics, and other skills to free-range learners. These groups exist so that people dont have to learn these things on their own, but ironically, their founders and teachers are often teaching themselves how to teach. Theres a better way. Just as knowing a few basic facts about germs and nutrition can help you stay healthy, knowing a few things about cognitive psychology, instructional design, inclusivity, and community organization can help you be a more effective teacher.

It was an inspiring experience from which I learned a great deal. My colleagues patiently explained the principles of Agile software development and together we applied them to the data science context.All these experiences culminated in the workflow that we now adhere to at work and I think it is worthwhile to share it. It is heavily based on the principles of Agile software production, hence the title.

But, drawing from a concept in urban planning, there are far fewer resources in the middle. Stretching the metaphor perhaps to its breaking point, new R users at the detached single-family home stage cant get to the advanced mid-rise level without going through the middle stage. The missing middle in the R neighborhood is the lack of resources to that answer the types of nuts and bolts questions that new R users often have. Things like: How should I organize my file structure when creating a new project? Should I do data cleaning in an RMarkdown file or an R script file? How do I find packages? How do I know if the packages I find are high quality?
