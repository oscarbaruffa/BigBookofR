Im guessing that if youre interested in R then you also like data ;). I initially used Google Analytics for this site but as Im keen to enhance user privacy I switched to Plausible Analytics from 30 December 2020 onward. You can view the old Google Analytics summary report PDF here. TLDR 22k unique visitors and 33k sessions between August 2020 and December 2020 :D!! Note that unique visits will be higher in Plausible than youd find with Google Analytics. Because Plausible is GDPR compliant and privacy focused, each user is identified for only 1 day. If someone visits the site 2 days in a row, thats counted as 2 uniques whereas in Google Analytics it would only be counted as 1 unique visitor because of the presence of persistent cookies and such that allows for tracking of users.

But the material may be useful if you want to refresh your memory, if you have not used R much, or if you feel confused. https://rspatial.org/intr/index.html 19.25 Another Book on Data Science : Learn R and Python in Parallel Nailong Zhang There has been considerable debate over choosing R vs. Python for Data Science. Based on my limited knowledge/experience, both R and Python are great languages and are worth learning; so why not learn them together? Besides the side-by-side comparison of the two popular languages used in Data Science, this book also focuses on the translation from mathematical models to codes. In the book, the audience could find the applications/implementations of some important algorithms from scratch, such as maximum likelihood estimation, inversion sampling, copula simulation, simulated annealing, bootstrapping, linear regression (lasso/ridge regression), logistic regression, gradient boosting trees, etc. https://www.anotherbookondatascience.com/ 19.26 Functional Programming in R Thomas Mailund Master functions and discover how to write functional programs in R.

Paid ~$25 https://amzn.to/2CDqhAU 19.31 An Introduction to R Alex Douglas, Deon Roos, Ana Couto, Francesca Mancini and David Lusseau The aim of this book is to introduce you to using R, a powerful and flexible interactive environment for statistical computing and research. R in itself is not difficult to learn, but as with learning any new language (spoken or computer) the initial learning curve can be a little steep and somewhat daunting. We have tried to simplify the content of this book as much as possible and have based it on our own personal experience of teaching (and learning) R over the last 15 years. It is not intended to cover everything there is to know about R - that would be an impossible task. Neither is it intended to be an introductory statistics course, although you will be using some simple statistics to highlight some of Rs capabilities. The main aim of this book is to help you climb the initial learning curve and provide you with the basic skills and experience (and confidence!) to enable you to further your experience in using R. https://intro2r.com/ 19.32 An Introduction to Data Analysis Michael Franke This book provides basic reading material for an introduction to data analysis.

We have explored which of the concepts from Agile did and did not work for data science and we got hands-on experience in working from these principles in an R project that actually got to production. https://edwinth.github.io/ADSwR/ 27.2 The Data Validation Cookbook Mark P.J. van der Loo The purposes of this book include demonstrating the main tools and workflows of the validate package, giving examples of common data validation tasks, and showing how to analyze data validation results. https://data-cleaning.github.io/validate/ 27.3 How I Use R David Keyes // R for the Rest of Us There are many great learning resources at the beginner stage and some incredible tutorials to master complex tasks in R. But, drawing from a concept in urban planning, there are far fewer resources in the middle. Stretching the metaphor perhaps to its breaking point, new R users at the detached single-family home stage cant get to the advanced mid-rise level without going through the middle stage. The missing middle in the R neighborhood is the lack of resources to that answer the types of nuts and bolts questions that new R users often have. Things like: How should I organize my file structure when creating a new project? Should I do data cleaning in an RMarkdown file or an R script file? How do I find packages? How do I know if the packages I find are high quality? This book is my attempt to provide answers to these types of questions. https://howiuser.com/ 27.4 Github actions with R Chris Brown, Murray Cadzow, Paula A Martinez, Rhydwyn McGuire, David Neuzerling, David Wilkinson, Saras Windecker GitHub actions allow us to trigger automated steps after we launch GitHub interactions such as when we push, pull, submit a pull request, or write an issue. https://ropenscilabs.github.io/actions_sandbox/ 27.5 The targets R Package User Manual Will Landau The targets package is a Make-like pipeline toolkit for Statistics and data science in R. With targets, you can maintain a reproducible workflow without repeating yourself. targets learns how your pipeline fits together, skips costly runtime for tasks that are already up to date, runs only the necessary computation, supports implicit parallel computing, abstracts files as R objects, and shows tangible evidence that the results match the underlying code and data. This manual is a step-by-step written guide to targets https://wlandau.github.io/targets-manual/index.html "],["other-compendiums.html", "28 Other compendiums 28.1 Bookdown archive 28.2 Use R!

Its a very very big repo. https://bookdown.org/home/archive/ 28.2 Use R! Springer series This is a collection of some 70+ books. This series of inexpensive and focused books on R will publish shorter books aimed at practitioners. Books can discuss the use of R in a particular subject area (e.g., epidemiology, econometrics, psychometrics) or as it relates to statistical topics (e.g., missing data, longitudinal data). All are paid products https://www.springer.com/series/6991?detailsPage=titles 28.3 Data Science with R: A Resource Compendium Martin Monkman This book grew out of my evergrowing collection of reference materials that was saved as an expanding array of markdown files in a github repo. By assembling it as a book, I hope that it will be more accessible and useful to other R users. https://bookdown.org/martin_monkman/DataScienceResources_book/ 28.4 R on the web Guillaume Coqueret Useful links for people interested in R. https://github.com/shokru/rstats/blob/master/material/R_links.md 28.5 CRAN doc collections Note these projects are frozen, but they do contain a lot of resources in multiple languages. Many of these are quite old publications, but it doesnt mean theyre outdated or not useful. If youre really digging for a specific resource that you cant find anywhere else, it may be here. Good luck! https://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html https://www.r-project.org/doc/bib/R-books.html "]]
